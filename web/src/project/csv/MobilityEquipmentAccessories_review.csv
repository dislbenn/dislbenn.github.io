If you plan on using crutches somewhat regularly or are suffering from a somewhat serious injury DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. First of all these crutches DO NOT come with rubber bottoms which is a safety hazard from my point of view. The grips are also very uncomfortable when compared to the padding of every other crutch out on the market. After only a couple uses you will have bruises on your hands from how bad the padding is. Also, there is no way anyone over 6ft can use these crutches comfortably or safely. The only advantage this item brings is that it folds."

With my glass tucked away safely, I have both hands free from dealing with the glass.

I have very progressive multiple sclerosis and can no longer walk nor stand (I'm 5'5' and 110lbs). I MUST tell you about my new (mentioned above) ""Duet #795 BU"" (BU stands for color Burgundy) It weighs 19lbs and I sit on it and grab onto door frames, furniture, fridge door handle, etc to pull myself around the apt (really fast even though my feet drag the floor a little). Then when my elderly Mom comes to take me out shopping/lunch with her, we leave my old standard 46lb wheelchair behind (she can BARELY lift that into and out of her car trunk) and take my new 19lb ""Duet"" instead. With the ""Duet"" we turn the back-support-bar around, flip down the hidden foot-rest-bar and voila! She can now push me around where ever we go. It has big 8"" wheels which make bumps smooth out, and has a huge vinyl bag under the seat. My Mom is soooo greatful! It is so much easier for me to pull myself around the apt and get right up to the toilet, sinks, fridge, bed etc than dealing with the protruding wheelchair foot rests sticking out in front of me. Since it sits up higher than my wheelchair, it is easier for me to transfer onto toilet, bed, etc. I hang Walmart bags on each handle, one for trash, the other for carrying stuff from room to room. Has given me freedom!"
