The price is great.

I take a lot of pills, in my humble opion, some prescribed by my medical doctor some determined by me from my research in Ortho Molecular Medicine. This pill dispenser keeps me accurate in taking the pills that I'm suppose to take, when I'm suppose to take them. It is no secret that some pills are best taken at certain times of the day. Other pills work synergistically with others, for example Vitamin C works synergistically with Rutin. This dispenser lets me accomplish that fact each week when I routinely schedule my pills, i.e. refill the dispenser, a process that I had a healthcare service want anywhere from $30.00 per month $150.00. This dispenser paid for itself in one week! Of course, I still had to “package the pills correctly.

I highly recommend this product or one like it for anyone who takes more than one or two pills multiple times throughout the day. I've recommended it to several people/friends verbally.
