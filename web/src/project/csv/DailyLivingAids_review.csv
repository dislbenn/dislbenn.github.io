I put the battery in and she placed  one in her good ear and gasped at the results, no squealing as I have had with other hearing devises. Then placed one in her bad ear and said it worked. Now she will not take them out.  I do not know how long they will last but as for now these things are great, so easy to use an 87 year old lady can operate them and you can get a set without breaking the bank, what else can you ask for?."

We bought an eyeglass kit to try that screw driver & it seems to have worked on one, but now the other ear piece is not working. Frustrating!

Oh, we did get one to work & he could hear sounds better but he complained of it sounding like he was hearing in a drum. Whether that was how it was supposed to be or would equal out with adjustment (see above!) & with the other piece but that is something we can't tell at this point in time!"

I take a lot of pills, in my humble opion, some prescribed by my medical doctor some determined by me from my research in Ortho Molecular Medicine. This pill dispenser keeps me accurate in taking the pills that I'm suppose to take, when I'm suppose to take them. It is no secret that some pills are best taken at certain times of the day. Other pills work synergistically with others, for example Vitamin C works synergistically with Rutin. This dispenser lets me accomplish that fact each week when I routinely schedule my pills, i.e. refill the dispenser, a process that I had a healthcare service want anywhere from $30.00 per month $150.00. This dispenser paid for itself in one week! Of course, I still had to “package the pills correctly.

I highly recommend this product or one like it for anyone who takes more than one or two pills multiple times throughout the day. I've recommended it to several people/friends verbally.
