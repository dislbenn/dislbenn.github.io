In the tub there seems to be just enough room on the bottom of the tub for the legs to be on a flat part on the bottom (not on the slope of the sides). The legs seem to be quite sturdy  and straight, not angled like on the aluminum models. I had an aluminum model my wife had bought for me after hip replacement surgery. The bottom of the legs went up on the slope a little in the tub and ended up bending (with me on it) , and it got embarrassing after that. Height of seat is great. I'm over 6 ft and adjusting legs to full height is more than adequate for me. I would definitely recommend this chair."

I had to tighten the legs before each shower.  If I had not discovered this the first time I took a shower, the chair might have collapsed under me.
Otherwise, this chair was a lifesaver because I had no help during my foot surgery recovery and was non-weightbearing for over two months.
The chair barely into my shower, which was a plus because there was no wiggle room for a fall.
It did not fit in my bathtub because it was slightly too wide. The the tub floor had sloped edges.
It did not feel stable (wobbbled).  I had to raise the legs to the max to be sure I could stand and sit straight down with only one leg in a slippery environment. And those legs loosened themselves which I was constantly aware of."

This has worked wonderfully for them as they are able to simply sit down and bathe, plus others can use the chair, like for shaving legs. It fits nicely in a small shower as well. The only thing I would change is to put suctions on the foot of the legs, so the chair is secure, but for us it hasn't been a problem with movement.

Fan out the rest so it's under the seat opening.  The white pad is a dried biodegradable gel that slowly works on the contents (long after you dispose of these!), so it's legal to drop these into a trash bag and put out with trash pickup.

Depending on how many toilets you have for claiming on a per-person basis, one of these bags will last one adult for about 2 days.  Luckily we had 2 toilets and 2 adults at the time!

My husband is in a wheelchair, fell recently, but fortunately did not get hurt. Both of us struggled to get him back into his wheelchair, but could not until a dear friend came to help us. What a blessing she was!
After this difficult experience, I was determined to look for a safe, small and easy to handle lift so that I don't have to ask someone again to help (who might hurt their back!)... and I found this one! I thought that if it works well in a bath tub, it should also work on a floor. I took a chance, ordered it and received it within 3 days. I am amazed how well this lift works because it is only 2"" high in the low position on the floor and lifts at a very slow, safe speed to 18"" which is the height of a wheelchair! After a fall, the (unhurt!) person can be gently pulled onto the lift, safely secured with a belt to the back of the lift, slowly lifted up and then easily transferred into the wheelchair! My friend and I have tried it out as a ""dry run"" and it works very well!! I have already ""demonstrated"" it to 2 nurses who want to order one for their facility.
The quality is excellent, very sturdy and well built (I am biased: Made in Germany!! :) ). From now on I will look for ""DRIVE"" products if I need more medical equipment. The high price was first a concern (fortunately I got it on a ""rollback"" deal), but it gives me peace of mind, and may be I can help another neighbor with it because it is so portable and weighs only 20 lbs.

Even now, that my ankle has healed, it is so nice to be able to sit to shave my legs, instead of leaning over, or holding onto the faucet. Another great feature about the Medline Bath Chair, is that it is adjustable, so it will fit you if you are tall or short. This is easy to do yourself. It also has holes in it, so if you need to wash and rinse, you can very easily while seated. The Medline Bath Chair would be good for those who tire or run out of breath easily, because they can just sit and relax while bathing. You can even dry yourself off while seated. It is an attractive chair, not bulky, so it will fit in your shower. It is lightweight, and has rubber on the ends of the legs, so there is no fear of slipping. The only thing I would change, is that I wish they came in different colors to match your bathroom decor. But, the light blue is ok. The chair is easy to clean. Since it is in my shower, I just wash it off and then spray it with my hand held sprayer. If you don't have a hand held sprayer, then just the shower spray would rinse it. The Medline Bath Chair is a useful chair for anyone."

The bench arrived via the mail in excellent shape. Upon opening the box, it contained only six-bench pieces and a basic instruction – warranty booklet. The instructions are pretty thin, but you can quickly see how it all comes together. It requires no tools for assembly or for possible later height adjustments. The pieces all snap together quickly and easily (5 minutes), using a simple spring loaded metal ball and hole type connections. The seat has six easy to adjust height positions: 1-6 (16” – 21”). I really like this feature, as I can quickly adjust the height, based on my needs for the bathtub or shower. The seat size is 20” w x 12” D, with plenty of sitting space; and has perforated holes in it for drainage. It is very lightweight (9.38 pounds) and is easily enough to move for proper positioning, or to get it out of your way. Even though it is easy to move, the bench is very stable and well balanced. The seat has two easy to grip integrated handles on each end (L/R) and one at the top of the backrest. The width of the tub needs to be at least 17” wide at the base, in order for the legs to sit safely on the tub bottom. Each four legs have well made rubber feet, which grip well to the tub and shower floors. The support structure is made of lightweight rust-resistant, aluminum frame. The seat and backrest are made of Microban, a antimicrobial product, which helps prevent the growth of stain and odor-causing bacteria, mold, and mildew. The seat will only hold up to 300 pounds, so if you are close to the max weight, I would purchase one with a higher weight rating. I really do like this bench, as it is well designed, lightweight, and easy to take back apart for storage or transport."

Have been thinking recently how I need a shower chair for times like these. Wishing I had ordered one before. About noon, the delivery man knocked on the door with my Medline Bath Chair with Microban Treatment. Alrright! The box was surprisingly light when he handed it to me. The packing is compact (and recyclable :) It was literally less than 5 minutes from the time I opened the package until I had the Medline Bath Chair assembled and in the tub! I love that I can set the leg height so the seat is at 20 inches...(the instructions have a little chart for matching seat height with number of hole on the leg adjustment). When my back is out, I cannot sit low and often, as today, do not feel safe and steady standing for any length of time as my leg feels like it will give out. The rubber feet on the chair are thick and sturdy, but do not have extreme suction, so it is not hard to remove the chair from the tub for cleaning or storage when I don't need to use it. I am so happy to have the Medline Bath Chair and be able to safely take a shower when my back is not up to par! I would recommend to anyone who needs tub/shower safety and is still able to maneuver themselves into tub by stepping over the edge. This is a great product, as far as I am concerned. The instructions are in both English and Spanish, another bonus."

She's up and running (figuratively) now, but having this Medline Bath Chair in the tub makes showering easy. Getting in and out of the tub was a struggle before and after her surgery. Having this bath chair makes it so much easier. I've got all my original parts (mostly) but sometimes after a long day or a tough workout, you just need to sit down and let the hot water wash it all away.

This was extremely easy to put together. It took five minutes tops. Most of those five minutes was just adjusting it to the correct height for Mom. It is very sturdy and the rubber caps on the legs mean that the chair isn't going to move when you're sitting down or getting up.

I'm not exactly sure what the Microban part is, but if it means that it will keep the chair looking (and smelling) clean and germ free, I'm here for it.

I would definitely recommend this Medline Bath Chair to anyone who is a little unsteady on their feet in the tub or shower. I would also recommend it for folks like me, who are just a little lazy every once in a while."

I use it in a tub, have the legs taller outside the tub and shorter inside,there are rubber caps on each leg that prevent the chair from sliding. The seat has holes that let the water drain away from your body. The height makes it easy to use, My arm is broken so I can sit on the outside and slide my body over into the tub. I know that it could be used if I was having to enter from a wheelchair also ,as you could just slide from chair to chair with ease. I don't want to have to use it for that but I feel it is sturdy enough for any injury requiring assistance. Once in the tub I pull the shower curtain as normal, there is a separation in a section of the preset seat that the curtain will lay in that prevents water from running outside the tub. I use a shower head with a long hose that works especially well if you are unable to stand or not stand for very long.

However, the locking device seems almost unnecessary since you can just slip the probe on the seat under your raised toilet seat lid without installing the part over your bolts. The fault I find is the tiny rubber pcs. which go under the front of the seat to stabilize and keep the Carex seat from slipping side to side, etc. They FALL OFF. I could tell they would. The seat was solid when I first put it on the toilet, but when I had to take it off because I was having someone visit--the little rubber piece fell off one side and into the toilet and was flushed away before I could retrieve it. So there is now one stabilizing rubber piece and I am so nervous when I lift the seat off that it too will fall in toilet. Surely the manufacture does not believe that the seat will never be coming off the toilet! The tiny pieces are needed."

Neither one had a lower space at the front to allow easy cleaning yourself. The first one also had permanently attached side handles. But in reality it made it difficult, no, impossible for cleaning yourself because it was more like sitting in a vise with no side to side movement at all. Looks good in the picture, but really a stupid design.

The one we purchased from Walmart was perfect. We will keep this one. Easy to install. Loosen the toilet screws, but do not remove. Slide piece of plastic under the screws. Tighten screws. Now the raised seat (only 4 inches high) just slides into the plastic that you put onto the toilet. To remove for cleaning, just slide it out. To put back, just slide it back on. Has a dip in the front, and the opening is larger. The only two problems in the design are 1. It's open on the bottom. Should be solid. 2. Needs a flat surface on bottom to stick piece of rubber to prevent sliding. It just slides a little, but would prefer that it didn't slide at all."

What I love about this toilet seat is that it is so stable, there is no movement at all. I love that you can take it on or off in case company comes. It also makes it a lot easier to clean. 
 You do have to loosen the bolts on the toilet seat to slip the plastic holding piece underneath. I did not have room to sleeve it in from the back like the instructions said to, however you CAN sleeve in from the front and it still works great. By doing it this way you don't have to take the original toilet seat all the way off :)   I also like that the area that sleeves down inside the toilet is MUCH longer than other toilet seats, so that also keeps it more stable.   
I highly recommend this seat. The price through Walmart was the best I could find. A huge savings compared to medical supply places in town."

A grab bar in the shower seemed like a good idea. We have an acrylic shower enclosure, so I was not keen on drilling holes in the walls. This suction-installation device seemed like it was worth the try. I put it in about a week ago, and so far it has stuck like glue. It is not meant to take your full body weight, but rather to provide something to hold on to in order to maintain balance, and it has done that well so far. Our shower enclosure is a 'biscuit' color, so it would have been nice to have color choices other than white. Actually, ours seem to have a tinge of rose color to it in certain lights. I was pleased when I opened the package to find that instead of aqua as the complementary color as shown in the photos, it was a light gray which matches far better."

The instructions say that it is not for supporting your whole weight on, but I need a lot of support!  I also wondered if, even though the grip was strong now, how long would that last?  Will it still be gripping months from now when I start to trust it and lean a little bit too much on it and then down I go?  I saw no reviews that said how long theirs lasted.  I just didn't trust the suction to last, so for that reason, and not actually how it performed while I had it, I returned the rail back to the store.

It does not have a sliding seat or anything sophisticated, but for a patient who can assist in his/her own movement it is excellent, and a real bargain. It is intended for use inside a regular bathtub, but is more useful in more situations than a simple shower chair, which assumes that a patient can use both legs to climb in. If a patient cannot use at least one leg, being able to sit down outside the tub and lift the legs over is ideal, but many of these benches are pretty pricey. This one does the job at a bargain price. The half that goes inside the tub has a pair of large suction cups on the legs to anchor it. The grab handle is solid and angled slightly away from the body so that the patient is not cramped up against it. The legs are adjustable up or down, and the back is both removable and reversible, all for maximum utility."

This product is virtually identical to the bench we use in therapy at my facility, except this product costs $100 less. This bench is sturdy, offers a variety of adjustable heights, will accommodate left or right tub set-ups with shower head configuration on either side. The suction cups on the inside legs are a must to ensure stability and safety. Other comparable products don't have these. The bench offers enough holes/openings on the seat to ensure proper water drainage to prevent overflow spills outside the tub. Another feature I like is that there are three seat sections on the bench, as opposed one solid section. This allows for a shower curtain to more easily be tucked in and around the bench. A tip to effectively seal the curtain around the bench is to either purchase two curtains or cut one curtain in half. You then cut out a horizontal slit on each (inner curtain on the side closest to the bench). The slit should be where the actual seat is, in order to pass by the metal frame and be tucked in between two seat sections. Then use Velcro or adhesive magnets to attach the curtains to each other. Hope this was helpful."

Finally, NO ONE can touch Walmart for pricing. I started at a medical supply store who would not quote me any price until they had all of my insurance information. I told them that I had not paid my deductable and would have to pay out of pocket to which they replied, the price changes depending on your insurance company's discounts.

You cannot reach behind you while seated so that presents a wiping problem. You cannot reach through from the front because the seat opening is considerably smaller that a regular commode seat and allows no access from the front. The ""dip"" around the rim produces a ""squeeze"" that makes the opening feel even smaller and actually repositions your ""business""  units to where they intersect the rim edge instead of being inside the opening. That creates a mess. On the first use, both of us urinated in the floor and on our clothing. #2 was not possible for me because the ""squeeze/dip"" would not allow a natural opening/spread. Both of us had to get off the unit in order to reach the areas needing wiping. The only positive things about the unit is that it makes getting up and down quite easy and it is quite sturdy, but we couldn't conduct any business while in the seated position. It is useless for us as it is. I may try to enlarge the lid hole size and eliminate some of the ""dip""to see if that helps."

Once installed, the seat was unstable until I applied some non-slip pads to the bottom of the elevator, near the front, to prevent lateral shifting. The device now works as expected. I would recommend this item to a friend with caveats based upon my experience."

My husband recently fractured his back so we now needed one for our home, as well. It's the best possible answer for a difficult situation. It's not too commercial looking and you can maintain the use of your toilet lid."

Easy to get up after using & also looks nice.  However, when it comes to keeping it clean is impossible.  Where the riser sits on the toilet can't be cleaned unless you dismantle the riser. Waste water accumulates & becomes a breeding ground for bacteria.  Would have to dismantle on a regular basis to minimize bacterial growth."

Was looking for a riser that I could put the regular seat and lid on top of it.
