the chair is very compact and is easy and fast to unfold for use. it takes up limited space when traveling and can easily fit in a back seat area or trunk of a car. the framework is extremely sturdy and my parent has nothing but praise for its comfortable and stable ride.

It fits through the doorways in my very old city apartment and it has brakes at the wheels that I can use (as opposed to most transport chairs that have handbrakes for the person pushing you.)

I loved it so much, I wanted to order another one and Walmart had a great price.  But here's the problem: The material on the seat and chair back stink.  I don't mean an unpleasant odor, I mean they reek of some sort of chemical coating.

I even called the manufacturer directly and they said that, yes, some folks had had the same problem but they thought I should still go ahead and get a replacement for the chair from Walmart, which I did.

But...the replacement chair had the exact same problem: Chemical smell.

The Customer Service Rep at Drive was very helpful and suggested that they send me two replacement parts for the chair back and seat. They arrived promptly. Seat was correct part, back of chair, was not the right part.

They sent a second shipment. Same problem, wrong back.

Then, showing incredible initiative, they sent me a chair! Alas, same problem, which you can only tell by opening box and then removing the plastic covering (just opening box you can't immediately smell it). While this chair's fabric had less of a smell, it still reeked. I can't tolerate the smell in my  home and I can't imagine going out on the city bus and/or sitting in a venue for an event with this smell. People would ask me to leave, it is that unpleasant.

at time of writing this, manufacturer is still seeking a solution. Why they can't find the second part is beyond me? You either make it and keep it in inventory or you don't. But I do appreciate both Walmart (which issued two return labels and had FedEx pick up from me for both chairs that were returned and issued a very speedy credit) and Drive Medical customer service, which were both exceptional, especially Drive.

FYI: I had done extensive research before and recently on transport chairs and this is the only one in my price range (you can find things at $200 and up!) that met my specific needs.

My first chair, which I got in December, 2014, is still in use and held up well, although brakes have to be tightened periodically. It's a great model but whomever Drive got this material from, they need to replace these seat and back pieces. If I got two, you can be sure there are others out there.

I would have ordered from another retailer but since they are not available in person, only via online, and I can't check for the smell, it makes no sense to keep getting chairs and having to send back. It's a real hassle as I live in a big city and deliveries and pickups are a problem and my aide is only here a very few hours.

I'm hoping to hear back from Drive that they have found the part and I can switch them out and use the chair.

FYI: You can't wash the fabric, and the smell does not fade. I'm very familiar with textile issues and this is a chemical coating that clearly is the wrong formula or was applied too much or otherwise incorrectly."

The seat is comfortable, leg rest is sturdy and wheels are very smooth. We find it very easy to maneuver the chair to just any place inside our apartment. The breaks are good as well however I would have liked the chair to go completely stationery when breaks are applied. In this case, it's not so; the chair tends to move back and forth a little when my mother attempts to step out of it. That's my only concern with the chair , other than that, I think it's a good, sturdy and reliable chair. Comes into our car boot also very comfortably. My husband is able to put it inside without much ado but I find it a challenge as it's heavy for me. I think it weighs 44 pounds. Not sure, Pl check details before buying.

He is 6'2"" 255 lbs. and the doorways are 29"" wide. The chair has arms that can be pushed right up to the kitchen table for meals too. The arms are not fixed, it would be nice if they were. The legs supports were the only parts not assembled. It was easy to put together. Overall it is a great price and it looks well design with the exception of the arms (they are meant to be removable, the biggest issues is that if you try to grab the chair by the arm and pull the chair, the arm comes free from the lock keeping it in place) . It seats comfortably and rolls nicely. 
Bottom line - for the nasty, cracked chair that Humanna wanted to charge $20/ month x 13 months, this is a better option and it fits my FIL and through the doorways. 
If you go to the manufacture website there is a nice chart with each model chair and their features and measurements. Made it much easier to narrow it down to what model we wanted. Also, it looks like you can purchase replacement parts from the manufacture as well...bonus for that!"

I saw this one and thought it would be perfect for our needs and I was right! It was delivered to my Walmart within days of ordering it. I was pleasantly surprised that the construction is so nice and sturdy. When it came, there was minimal assembly which was such a relief. I am a bigger person and I fit comfortably and feel secure when I am in it. The seat, back, leg rests, and arm rests are very comfortable. My husband says it is easy to maneuver. One of my doctors remarked, ""What a nice wheelchair!"" I think I got a great bargain especially since we don't know how long we will need it. This chair is more than worth the money!! I would highly recommend this chair to anyone who needs a sturdy non-electric wheelchair! Thank you Walmart!!"

It's light enough my wife can put it in the car herself, something she couldn't do with our prior ""lightweight"" small (16in seat) wheelchair. The foot rests will have to be lowered for practically all users - even my 5'1"" mother-in-law. The seat is approx 4-5 inches lower than most typical wheelchairs. My wife thought it might be that way so the used can shuffle themselves around using their feet on the ground. Because of the low height, she needed a cushion under her to get a better table seating height. A good side effect is that the arms are low enough to go completely under most tables - so one can ""belly up"" to the table. The folding back handles make it easy for stowing in cars. The swinging footrests don't latch into locked position as easily as they should - I'm thinking that may get better with some use. All in all, a very good value for the money."

I had ordered a different one previously, and the seat with was too narrow. Very important to look at how the measurements are taken. For this one,  The seat with is actually 19 inches as stated, because the measurement is all inside the handrails. On the previous one I ordered, the seat width was reduced by 2 inches because the handrail overlapped to the inside of the seat and cut into her legs. Lightweight, easy open/close.  Legs rests are removable - only downside is that their is no mechanism for  transporting the leg rests,  other than to carry them separately, or leave them connected (and it makes it cumbersome to carry since they don't lock in place and swing in/out while carrying the chair). I put them in a small tote bag to carry them, and snap them on once I open the chair.  Still, a great chair, and works great. My mom is very comfortable when we do have to use it.

Great value for the money. One minor flaw that should be adjusted by the manufacturer: the detachable wheels come off too easily when closed and in the trunk, and then they have to be reattached for each use. Not difficult, but in rain and wind, it can be a bit of a nuisance. I still would recommend this chair to anyone who is thinking about it.

This chair is good for people on the not-too-large size - he's about 5'11, 190lbs and it is fine but I think someone over 225lbs would have a tight squeeze on the seat. Note that it has small wheels, not big wheels like a regular wheelchair, so it takes a little bit of muscle to move someone around, especially up a ramp - the seated person can't help by pushing the wheels. It's not a heavy duty chair - when crossing bumps in a floor (carpet edges and such), try to hit them at a perpendicular angle as I don't think the chair is up for much twisting action. The chair is really lightweight and folds up pretty well so it's really easy to put in a hatchback.

Well I read through the numerous reviews and found for the most part people were happy with the item. I took a chance and ordered this model. Even though I am not an expert on wheelchair construction I do find this to be a very sturdy solidly built wheelchair. The pocket on the back is a plus. I purchased the 20"" so there would be a little extra wiggle room for my husband and he can add a pillow or blanket, or tuck a book next to him. The wheels are not slippery on this particular model and it is light enough for me to lift into the SUV. Setting it up was a whiz. It comes completely assembled. Just take it out of the box, remove the wrappings and put on the removable foot pedals. Plus, watch for the little tightening tool that comes with it just in case a bolt is loose.

I should also mention that I do not use a rollator daily. I only need it occasionally when a condition I have makes walking painful.

This rollator had three things important to me:

- Comfortable seat and backrest-soft fabric. Makes eating at the table much more comfortable.
- Easy to fold - folds side-to-side, rather than front to back. Has convenient clip to hold it together when folded. VERY narrow when folded.
- Soft grip rubber tires - needed to grip floor and not slide when sitting or standing. Also very quiet when rolling across hardwood or tile floors. Be wary of harder, black PVC tires.

The large 10"" front tires roll easily over a threshold that stopped 6"" tires on a borrowed rollator cold!

I also like the brake cables running down INSIDE the frame. Loose cables are a pain!

A bonus is the fabric storage pouch folds automatically when you fold it without having to remove it.

The one complaint I had was an odor that existed in the box in which the wheelchair was sent. At first, I was concerned that the odor was associated with the fabric of the wheelchair, However, once the wheelchair was removed from the box, the odor has gradually dissipated.

Like the big wheels in the back for small curbs and bumps that needed to be backed into. Comfortable seat for day trips. Foot pedals swing back for convenience at restaurants and getting in and out of the car. Would highly recommend for temporary use or short durations. Not really designed for those confined to a wheelchair for long term use or for long periods of time.

I like it because it folds up, is light weight and I can get it in the car trunk by myself with no problem. It's made very well and looks nice.

This chair is perfect - easy of use and is narrow enough for the hallway. The wheels are great for use on the carpet in the house as well. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a chair for transporting and getting around in the house. My husband (who the chair is for) says it rides nice and doesn't feel bumps. A breeze to attach the leg holders and to fold for storage.
Well worth the money."
Wheelchairs,Walmart #  004077576,Drive Medical Lightweight Blue Transport Wheelchair,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Drive-Medical-Lightweight-Blue-Transport-Wheelchair/14563677,"I love how light weight and sturdy this chair is. Got it for my mom. She is about 120 lbs. The chair is supposed to hold up to 300 lbs and it probably would but I don't think it is wide enough to fit someone that size. The only thing I don't really like is that when you fold it the foot rests don't lock into place. The chair also does not lock shut. Because of this , when you pick it up the chair opens a little but the worst is the foot rests either flop around or fall off. I have had to use a small bungee cord to hold everything together. I also used it at a park on the grass and it was very easy to control and rolled pretty good over the uneven ground. It did not feel like it would tip over. I would give this five starts if there was some thing that held the footrests in place when the chair was folded. Also the footrests length are not tool free adjustable. Theycan only be adjusted by using a wrench. This was not a big deal for me because no one other than my mom will be using the chair so I only had to adjust once."

Over all good chair. But the seat needs to go up higher and the foot rest needs to go out further. At max setting it is good for me at 5'6 but my husband is the one that uses the chair and he is 6'2 so over all it is too small. Would also like more padding in the seat.

He is 6'2"" 255 lbs. and the doorways are 29"" wide. The chair has arms that can be pushed right up to the kitchen table for meals too. The arms are not fixed, it would be nice if they were. The legs supports were the only parts not assembled. It was easy to put together. Overall it is a great price and it looks well design with the exception of the arms (they are meant to be removable, the biggest issues is that if you try to grab the chair by the arm and pull the chair, the arm comes free from the lock keeping it in place) . It seats comfortably and rolls nicely. 
Bottom line - for the nasty, cracked chair that Humanna wanted to charge $20/ month x 13 months, this is a better option and it fits my FIL and through the doorways. 
If you go to the manufacture website there is a nice chart with each model chair and their features and measurements. Made it much easier to narrow it down to what model we wanted. Also, it looks like you can purchase replacement parts from the manufacture as well...bonus for that!"

This economical wheelchair rates superb when compared to a narrower $900 one that was given to us to use. The smaller one is more maneuverable, but that is about the only advantage when compared to this Cadillac of a wheelchair."

It is light weight and also compact. Folds up easily so it fits nicely into my van. Would also fit nicely into a car trunk and even behind the seat of a pick up truck. It is very easy to fold up and there is no need to have to remove the foot rest. Just unlock them and swing them around and they clip onto the side so they do not move when you try to put it in the trunk or van. I also like the handy side pouch connected to the side. It is perfect for carrying things. I used it to carry my wallet while shopping. Made it a lot easier than having to worry about having a purse. The pouch is big enough for other things too. I also put my bottle of water in it and with my wallet and water in it, I still had plenty of room for other things. The leg rest has height adjustments so it is perfect for short people and even taller one's. The handles fold down so they are out of the way when collapsed. The seat has handles on it to make it easy to pick up. For me, the seat is a little snug but for someone smaller, it is a good size. It is also durable and sturdy. I have always wanted a compact wheel chair so that it is easier to get in and out my van. I would definitely recommend the Medline Transport Chair to my friends and family, which I have already done.

The major difference between a wheelchair and this transport chair is that the transport chair does NOT have the wheels on it for an individual to move themselves around. Another person to move you around will be required. I use this transport chair for my mother and it is great. It folds up easily and is very light in comparison to a typical wheelchair. It supports up to 300 pounds and has a handy pouch on the side to store important items. Not having the wheels on the side did confuse my mother at first, but at her age she would not have the strength to move herself around with her arms regardless and with not having the wheels it does make is so much more convenient to store in the car and makes it half the weight of a typical wheelchair. When pushing or pulling the transport chair it glides like butter and is very easy to maneuver. The transport chair also has a seat belt and breaks that can be applied when not in motion. It is a great item for both the person in the chair and the person taking care of them."

We have been looking for a transport chair that is lightweight ,durable,folds small for easy storage. We also wanted leg rests. Well this Medline Basic Transport Chair has it all!!
The Transport chair is very easy to open up . All the moving pieces lock into place and have levers to easily unlock them. The handles fold back so that really makes the Transport Chair smaller to fold. You lift it up from the seat by two handles. It's a little heavy but doable I am a woman and I can lift it up and down to put in the car trunk all by myself. I sat in the Transport Chair it is very comfortable the back is nice and high I felt secure and snug. The chair itself holds up to 300 lbs. The chair was easy to move around. There is no big wheel so the person in the chair can not use there arms to push themselves, but they could use there feet to get around. My Grandmother liked to be in a wheelchair because she had a fear of falling but used her feet to get around . So this Medline Chair could also be use for someone like that. You could use this in a house that has room to get around if you can't stand up. This Medline Basic Transport chair will definitely give freedom to many people, whether just to move around room to room , or to take someone out to the park , the mall or a meal. You never know when something will happen if you have room it's a great peace of mind to know you have a portable transport chair in your home or car.

It arrived in two boxes, the smaller one fit right inside the larger one, great packing design, it was easy to pull the box with the chair out with the handles. Very easy instructions to follow to put together for use. It's very attractive looking not too flashy in color, nice burgundy. The transport chair seems to be well made with good quality material, compact, sturdy and durable. It is light weight easy to lift in and out of the back seat or trunk of a vehicle. The large wheels make for easy maneuvering, rolls smooth on concrete walkways, hard flooring and shorter carpet. The handles are positioned just right, it is design so the caretaker doesn't strain too hard while pushing the patient making it effortless. The foot rest snap right in place easy too move out of the way to get in and out of chair. I'm a caretaker for a patient who has problems walking long distance and needs a lot of assistance or a wheel chair to get around, I now take this transport chair instead of the larger wheel chair to the store, doctors appointments and restaurants it makes it so much easier for me. The seat is fairly comfortable but sits a little low, I will eventually purchase a cushion for better comfort and support. The arm rests are well placed for great leverage, especially sitting in front of a table. It is a perfect solution when a large wheelchair is just too heavy to bring, or for short trips into town. It folds down with ease making it a breeze to store. It should last a long time if taken care of proper."

into place and you are done. Fast and easy.

I love the feel of the seat. VERY comfortable. My neighbors all tried the chair. They are various weights and heights. It felt sturdy and safe. There are wheel brakes on each side of the back wheel. Very easy to apply.
It is a bit heavy for those who are on the weak side, but actually lighter than most wheel chairs.
All but one family member seemed to have no issues with the chair. The one that did have an issue was 6' 4' and has super long legs. However, all felt the chair glided smoothly on most surfaces. It also is able maneuver a sharp change of direction quickly. This is very important when you are at the mercy of those with better mobility.

The seat is padded and has very stable straps to pull the chair closed. The padding in on the seat and back.

There is a nice tote pack on the side armrest for carrying items.

The foot rests are super easy to extend or put away. It is a matter of flipping a lever, swinging back against the chair and snapping them into place. You can take them off completely, but not really needed with the wheels being able to be secured onto the chair.

The seat is nice and wide. For those of us in the upper years, this is very welcome. No latex so safe for those with allergies to latex.

The chair is neat looking and easy to store."

The chair folds up relatively easily although it takes some manipulating to get all the parts in the right spots so the main frame will fold completely. Traveling bag is nice but we don't use it because it is a hassle to get in and out of the bag, but if you want to take the chair on an airplane, for example, the bag would be very useful. The lightweight nature of the chair means it is made with lots of plastic, which tends to break easily. So far, only the heel strap peg has broken off, but I expect more parts to fall off as the chair gets used. Also, the wheels are hard plastic which makes for a rough ride on anything but the smoothest surfaces. The main problem I find with transport wheelchairs in general is that the occupant cannot put on the brakes. If you happen to get distracted and let go of the chair in hilly terrain, the chair and occupant tend to get away from you."
