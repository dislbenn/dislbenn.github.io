This model comes with color-through panels to hide scuffs and scratches and black wheel rims.","The only regret I have in buying this scooter is the fact I didn't get it sooner. It was very easy to put together and adjust to my size. I'm 5'8, 195 pounds and I don't find it small or confining as others have stated. I received the smaller batteries and already have found them to be more than adequate for my needs. Other companies charge twice the price and their batteries are rated for less distance than this one. I have yet to discharge the battery more than 1/4 capacity. The gauge has never fallen below the second green light. Yes, it has plastic wheels so you will feel a slight jarring when going over uneven pavement (the same as those free scooters at supermarkets), but the upside is that you don't have to watch tire pressure for inflatible tires; these should last a long time. The seat is comfortable. I went from early morning to late afternoon at a large two story mall and had no aches or pains. I cannot use the highest speed as those walking with me have said they can't keep up with me at high speed. I've taken it up steep ramps from an underground parking garage at a hospital with no problems. You do have to be careful when making sharp turns. No four wheel scooter is going to have the small turning radius as a three wheeler, but the stability more than makes up for this minor inconvenience. All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this Drive scooter."

I slowly saw my active life going downhill and being stuck in the house with no normal life.  Insurance doesnt cover mobility scooters if you need outside the house mainly even if you have a lot of doctors appointments on a regular basis like myself. I did my research for over a month checking out other companies and units. Because paying out-of-pocket this was most reasonable even on a low budget. This model is normally over $900 to $1,700. From medical supplies companies. At first I thought there was something wrong with the pricing. But I called Drive Medical to make sure there wasnt a catch, that they are official equipment. The rep was amazed that the price was half the amount the medical supplies stores and providers have them for. But these come direct from Drive Medical. No going to the medical place or doctors to get it which saves you & your insurance. This is your item you own this. When going through Insurance it is only rented is not technically yours until i beleive mth 15. 

I put the scooter together myself it took a little longer than the two minutes due to being handicapped obviously. It was very easy besides tightening the seat nut and bolt. I had to find tool for that was just right. The only downfall was they didn't say you had to flip a knob on the front to get the wheels unlocked in the manual which is not Walmart's fault.

I took it for a test ride down to the shopping center 1.6 miles from my house it took me about 28 minutes because I had 3 main street lights to cross and a little down hill incline. Which the scooter handled well it would not handle much more of an incline going up. Which they do state limits for inclined. Went to a grocery store & a discount store which I was in about an hour going up and down the aisles. I was driving the scooter about 2 hours total before it was down to red lights. I did turn the power off while waiting at the stop lights as well as waiting in line at the grocery store I'm not sure if that would have wore the battery down more or if it helps but I was just trying it out. Lol the basket holds a decent amount of stuff and I also could put groceries on the floor. 

The fact that it's compatible it's perfect for trips I'll be taking it when I go to Niagara Falls verse rent one period when flying or taking a bus the luggage can go on the floor of the scooter so its better then a rolator or wheelchair. Is very handi. It charged very fast to the full power I want to say it took a few hours. But that's not bad since it went to fully powered.  I use a pillow for added comfort & height. 

The Paratransit busses have room for these and now I am able to get out of the house and do normal people activities which I couldn't do before I got this. I would struggle using a rollator in a wheelchair. A very good investment. Now I just need to either learn the hand signals or find signals to put on the back seat & basket. Lol  I will be buying the little light to put on the basket for night time. 

Drive Medical said they do cover the warranty just have to call them with the units number. I just don't know where to find that since it's not with the paper or in manual."
