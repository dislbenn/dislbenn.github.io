I have used Classic II model in the past and it really lasted for years. I bought this model Classic III, Burgundy with Steel Chest piece, as a gift to my wife who is pursuing her PG in Internal Medicine. In less than 2 months the Diaphragm became loose and kept falling off the chest piece and lost it. I have replaced it but the result is same, as i lost the second replacement too. Two times the diaphragm was lost. I have found out that her colleagues who use the same model tend to have the same issue. Second, regarding the tube. Its been 8 months since i bought this model. The usage was normal, without any mishandling. Cracks appeared all along the tube  which got punctured leaving a big hole at the center. In less than a year, the stethoscope was broken and it is completely useless. The quality is so degraded that my previous stethoscope from the same brand lasted for years and while this one lasted only months. I feel so embarrassed that I have given a gift that has a pathetic quality. I have tried contacting you via e-mail but I didn't get a reply from you and hence I am posting this review. I really need an explanation regarding this from your side and probably a replacement or a possible refund at the earliest.

I do agree with the previous review on this site that the head swivel is also too loose, and it moves making difficulty for listening. But now I can't use it at all!!

I have to say “Disappointed” for my Littmenn Cardiology IV. The material of Cardio III is a lot stronger and higher quality. For the Cardio IV, Quality is missing!

PatientCare,Walmart #  563687063,Philips HeartStart Home Defibrillator - AED,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Philips-HeartStart-Home-Defibrillator-AED/10740651,"We purchased the Phillips HeartStart Defibrillator after recertifying our CPR/AED card. I plan to use it on my commercial fishing vessel in the summer. Last year we had a scare on board the vessel where a crewman needed to be medivaced from the fishing grounds to a hospital with a suspected heart attack. It makes sense to have this cheap insurance around in case another episode like this happens in the future.
In the off fishing season we will leave it at my parents house as our family has a history of heart troubles.
It is hard to imagine not having this life saving technology around as these AED's are easy for anyone to use.
Fortunately we have not yet had to use this device, but have it hanging around just in case. The order shipped out fast and arrived as promised with all of the equipment it promised.
It is one of the only things I have ever bought that I will deem a great investment even if I never use it."

I picked what I thought would meet my shop needs and fit my hands okay.

The Curad gloves are great and are wonderful for small jobs around the garage (like treating leather saddle bags with black leather dye/conditioner, etc.) are great!

Delivery estimate was 3-5 days, but to my pleasant surprise the gloves arrived in 2 days.

The only short-coming I saw was that I really don't see or feel any ""texture"" in the gloves. Also, they dissolve around any oil based products, but I think all latex gloves do.

Great gloves for the price!"

This mat hurts when you first lay on it especially on those really tight areas. Even if your full clothed it still can be quite painful laying down on it. It takes a few minutes to adjust your body to the right position when laying on your back. After the initial pains it quickly feels comfortable and eventually feels good. I had no problem reading, watching TV and taking a short nap once my body adjusted to the mat. You can try pull your legs up and elevating them when on your back to get the middle of your back and spine. You can feel the blood start racing through your body when using it which is great for your circulation. Once I get off of the mat I can feel a noticeable difference in my muscles. The effect is short term but I'll take it. Be very careful when handling the mat and pillow the plastic points are very sharp."

Again no problem. I don't pretend to know how it works; I just know that the case does work. The Frio instructions say to immerse the cooling pack in cold water for 8-10 minutes. I accidentally left it in for 30 minutes. The pack tripled in size but still fit in the case and took weeks to dry out. I mention this because it had no effect on performance."

Quinine is the most effective substance against leg cramps. While the product still helps a bit without Quinine the same and is not what is advertised.  You can get the same product they ship at the same price from Walmart shelves.  Don't order if you are looking for a product with Quinine.

This item feels cheaply made, like something from the dollar store. It is also practically worthless for listening to a heartbeat or lungs. I had high hopes for it because the 1 review it had was 5 stars, but this item is no 5 star item. I'd recommend buying another Stethoscope something with better quality, and will work better. :("

They are latex free for those who are allergic to latex and they are powder free, so that gets rid of that mess when you take them off, but just because they don't have powder, they still slide on and off very easily.
After I get taken care of in the morning and am ready for the day, I usually create a mess after my aide leaves and I can't stand a mess so I don't wait until he gets here in the morning so I use these gloves when I do dishes, or pick up clothes, almost everything. I am always switching gloves to a new pair and I hate the kind with powder in them because I have to wash and dry my hands before I can put on a new pair of gloves and with these it's just a quick change.
Another good thing to use these gloves for is for the person who likes to play in the garden or just likes to play with indoor plants and if you have to get into the dirt if you have a pair of these on your hands will stay clean.
One thing I haven't noticed as much or really at all yet is in the powder gloves my hands always sweat and in these gloves the don't. Maybe the powder causes them to get that way I don't know but when I take my gloves off they are dry and clean.
I would recommend these to anybody who wears these but like I said they are non-sterile and at 150 to a box there are multiple uses for them and they are cheap at that rate."

When it comes to disposable gloves-- I consider this a good thing. I was skeptical of them being made of vinyl. Other vinyl gloves I've tried have been rigid and felt like I had shower curtains on my hands! That was not the case with these. They are thicker than their latex counterparts but this didn't affect the usability or flexibility. To my delight, these gloves are very stretchy and do not break easily. As shown in the picture, even my nails couldn't puncture through very easily. I've used these gloves for everything from personal care to cleaning with heavy chemicals. They hold up wonderfully. I have a latex allergy and I did not get any type of reaction from these gloves. Overall I'd say these disposable gloves are top notch. I definitely recommend them."

I do not work in the medical field, just a gardener and a grandma. I knew planting time would soon be here and gardening gloves have never worked for me so I decided this year I would try something different. I chose these gloves not really knowing if they would be what I needed and was I surprised! They are perfect for outdoor work and inside work. I used them while painting flower pots, washing outdoor furniture, cleaning my garage. I love them. I had no problem getting them off and on and they didn't make my hands sweat as some gloves do. I didn't get any rips, tears while I had them on. I am sorry I can't give a medical opinion but for someone who works outside or inside, they are great. My rings didn't even cause a problem either in tearing the gloves or taking the gloves off. Yes, I will buy more"

When I don't have gloves for touching raw meats for cleaning and seasoning, I almost always end up switching to something a little more prep friendly. Which is most likely processed or something I wouldn't have otherwise eaten that day. I am getting back in the habit of cooking fish and poultry on a daily bases, so I need lots of gloves for rubbing in Olive Oil and spices. The temptation of ""borrowing"" an entire box from the doctor's office was neither allowed or morally acceptable, so I opted for these.

Having this 150 count pkg will ensure that I don't run out, even though I'll use them nearly everyday. Perfect for cleaning my fish tank and avoiding direct contact with that messy job. It's a plus that they are not powdered. That annoys me as well. They're flexible, well fitting and OCD friendly."
