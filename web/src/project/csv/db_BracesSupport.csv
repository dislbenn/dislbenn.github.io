Adjustable features offer the perfect fit. You're a person of your wordso keep those dates with the help of the ACE Brand Knee Brace with Dual Side stabilizers.","This is my 3rd Knee Brace and is by far the best one I've had. I began having problems with my knee and bought something that was nothing more than an elastic bandage. It was junk. I then got one (not an Ace) that just wrapped around my leg above and below the knee. It provided support but had some problems. It would tend to slip down my leg. It had an opening between the top and bottom strap, so if I tightened it enough so it wouldn't slip, the flesh of my leg would bulge (swell) out the sides. The most annoying problem was that it would irritate the back of my knee and cause substantial itching, plus it seemed to make my leg sweat in that area. By the way it was made by a different manufacturer that begins with M.
This Ace has been MUCH MUCH better. You have to initially slide it up your leg (slight negative) because it has a smooth cloth that fits behind the knee and has not caused me any irritation there at all. It doesn't slip, I don't seem to sweat with it, and there is no irritation to the back of my knee. It has 3 straps that completely encapsulate the knee so I've had no bulging. It's a good product for me and I would definitely recommend it to others."

Slip on the supportive comfort of the ACE Adjustable Reversible Splint Wrist Brace.","This is a durable brace that works well for carpal tunnel therapy. The design has improved over the years and is generally very comfortable. My only complaint is that the sizing was more snug than I expected. Now that they have made the thumb loop a continuous part of the body, rather than a velcro adjustable part, the unit was initially more snug than I prefer. However, I have stretched it slightly by placing it over a jar when I am wearing my other supports, especially at night. It is now even more comfortable and does an excellent job when I am working at my keyboard.
Size info: my palm is 9.5inches at the width and my wrist is 7.75inches around. If your sizing is more than 1/4th inch larger than mine, this is probably not the unit you want."
