I have used Classic II model in the past and it really lasted for years. I bought this model Classic III, Burgundy with Steel Chest piece, as a gift to my wife who is pursuing her PG in Internal Medicine. In less than 2 months the Diaphragm became loose and kept falling off the chest piece and lost it. I have replaced it but the result is same, as i lost the second replacement too. Two times the diaphragm was lost. I have found out that her colleagues who use the same model tend to have the same issue. Second, regarding the tube. Its been 8 months since i bought this model. The usage was normal, without any mishandling. Cracks appeared all along the tube  which got punctured leaving a big hole at the center. In less than a year, the stethoscope was broken and it is completely useless.

The comfortable foam bed is covered in thousands of acupressure points, with a neck pillow also cov-ered in plastic needles to support your head and neck. As you lie down and rest on the mat, the pressure points work similarly to acupuncture treatments, which is said to stim-ulate the bodys meridian lines to promote healing. This process improves blood flow, helping the body to release toxins and promoting muscle recovery ideal for post-workout or during savasana at the end of a yoga session. As your body releases endor-phins from the acupressure, it helps to reduce pain in tight areas like the back, neck, and feet. It can be used not only lying down, but also while seated at a desk chair or on the couch. Set your feet on it when seated to help soothe weary soles at the end of a long day, or lay on your stomach to help with digestion. The mat is made of 100% cot-ton and plant-based eco foam which can be hand washed for a comfortable, long-lasting mat for relaxation.

Nubax Trio,$241.94,5.0/5.0,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Nubax-Trio/196465567,"The Nubax trio back traction provides gentle but strong and effective traction to the spine.

Used three times a day for 3 minutes a session, this back stretching machine can help relieve back pain and reduce tension in as little as 30 days.",This device makes stretching the lower back a simple task with little effort (Once the Nubax is assembled and useable.)  This is my second NuBax device.  I shared my first one with another who had serious low back pain and discomfort and after he discovered the benefits and relief it provided he begged to buy it from me.  So I needed a replacement.    This Nebax device is a very cleaver idea for low back pain relief and help in repairing compressed or buldging disks.
"Medline Powder-Free Synthetic Vinyl Exam Gloves, Med  ...",$54.994.0Â¢/each,4.5/5.0,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Medline-Powder-Free-Synthetic-Vinyl-Exam-Gloves-Medium-Case-of-1500/23955876,MediGuard Select Synthetic Exam Glove are a cost-effective alternative that's perfect for general patient care. New technology has improved the tactile sensitivity and durability of these quality latex- and powder-free gloves.,"These gloves are really nice fitting. They are latex free for those who are allergic to latex and they are powder free, so that gets rid of that mess when you take them off, but just because they don't have powder, they still slide on and off very easily.
After I get taken care of in the morning and am ready for the day, I usually create a mess after my aide leaves and I can't stand a mess so I don't wait until he gets here in the morning so I use these gloves when I do dishes, or pick up clothes, almost everything. I am always switching gloves to a new pair and I hate the kind with powder in them because I have to wash and dry my hands before I can put on a new pair of gloves and with these it's just a quick change.
Another good thing to use these gloves for is for the person who likes to play in the garden or just likes to play with indoor plants and if you have to get into the dirt if you have a pair of these on your hands will stay clean.
One thing I haven't noticed as much or really at all yet is in the powder gloves my hands always sweat and in these gloves the don't. Maybe the powder causes them to get that way I don't know but when I take my gloves off they are dry and clean.
I would recommend these to anybody who wears these but like I said they are non-sterile and at 150 to a box there are multiple uses for them and they are cheap at that rate."
Frio Duo Insulin Cooling Case,$19.99,4.0/5.0,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Frio-Duo-Insulin-Cooling-Case/36442149,,"I used this for two adult-sized epipens. The epis must be removed from their case to fit (snugly). I choose frio because you just soak the product in cold water. I followed the directions and it gelled up nicely. I put it in the carrying case and then in a tote bag. I was in humid 93Â°F weather for the past week. When my tote was in direct sunlight the gel pack felt warm/hot, unfortunately. But when I covered my bag with a poncho, or the pack was at the bottom of the tote, covered by other items, it felt lukewarm. But, that's better than hot.  At night, when it was in the mid'80s, the gel felt cool. I give this 3 stars because it's easy to travel with and prepare. The price was pretty high for not being cold like it says. It's supposed to keep cool in 100Â° F weather. But, I'd rather have the security of it than not at all."
