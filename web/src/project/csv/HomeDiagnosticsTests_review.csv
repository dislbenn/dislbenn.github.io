We provide you with one of the most detailed ancestry composition reports on the market today. You can find out about your ancestral origins, what percent of your DNA comes from populations around the world, your maternal and paternal lines and your neanderthal percentage.

You can view the reports included in our service here: https://www.23andme.com/dna-ancestry/

Ancestry Composition has the ability to assign pieces of your DNA at several geographic scales, according to where these pieces of DNA are found to be common throughout the world. For example, one piece of DNA might be found only in Finnish people, so we can with some confidence call this DNA ""Finnish"". Another piece of DNA might be found with some frequency in populations within England, Norway and Germany. Instead of choosing arbitrarily from among these regions, Ancestry Composition will label these pieces “Broadly Northern European.""

If a piece of DNA is found all over Europe, but not outside Europe, Ancestry Composition will label that DNA “Broadly European."" Pieces of DNA found in multiple widespread regions, such as Europe, the Near East, and Asia, will be labeled “Unassigned.”"

Please educate yourself prior to use & follow the directions.

We sprang the test on the individual who wanted us to test him randomly. My hubby supervised so no water could be added to the urine or other test ""tampering"". The young man told us what would show up in his system & yes, the test caught it. It caught the Opiates/Heroin & it caught Meth.

His wife & us have purchased more of these tests to spring on him. His wife happened to goof one test by putting the cup down vertically instead of horizontally which she hurried to correct. The test showed he was clean but you cant really rely on it at that point. We retested with a new kit & we were happy to see he was clean!

*Please also check with your local Health Department. In our area, they do drug screens for not more money than this test. Their tests provide more information & cover a broader spectrum of drugs. But, with that being said, you can't really give them a ""pop quiz"" like you can with one of these tests at home.

My heart goes out to addicts & their families/loved ones. There are options out there to help - even if you have no income.

God Bless."

First Check Case # 1026915<br /><br />Dear Maurice,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting First Check Diagnostics regarding our Home Drug Test Product Line. We appreciate your business and value your feedback. We are happy to address any questions or concerns you may have with our First Check products. <br /><br />In response to your email, the result is Preliminary Positive on the First Check Home Drug Test when No line appears next to the word Drug and a red or pink colored line appears next to the word Control between the 5 and 10 minute read time. A Preliminary Positive Screening Result on the First Check Home Drug Test means that either the level of drug detected on the home portion of the test is above the cut-off level of the test or a substance, such as an over-the-counter medication or prescription drug, may be cross-reacting to cause a Preliminary Positive Result. We recommend that you send all Preliminary Positive samples to our laboratory for free, confidential, confirmatory testing, per the instructions in our package insert. <br /><br />The First Check Home Tests are at least 99% accurate; however, it is possible that another test could be testing for something else or have a different cut-off level for the drug tested for. Also, we cannot guarantee the result on another test for several reasons: <br /><br />Each urine sample could contain different amounts of the drug because of: <br /><br />• The way the body clears the drug and a person’s metabolism. <br />• How much fluid you drank (how hydrated you are). Did you use first morning urine? <br />• How much of the drug was taken, the type of drug and the frequency of use. <br />• When the drug was taken in relation to testing. <br />• How close to the cut-off level the drug was in your urine sample. Samples near the cut-off level provide the greatest margin of error. <br />• If you plan on retesting, we recommend that you use first morning urine to ensure the most concentrated sample and limit the amount of fluids you are drinking. <br /><br />Did you send the 2 samples that you tested on the 2 different First Check Home Drug tests to our laboratory for free, confidential, confirmatory testing, per the instructions in our package insert?  If so, could you please provide the Sample ID #s of the 2 samples that you sent to our laboratory for free, confidential, confirmatory testing? <br /><br />Could you please provide the complete names of the 2 First Check Home Drug tests you used and the dates that you performed each of the tests? <br /><br />Could you please provide the name of the test performed at that the lab you went to?  And, could you please provide the sample type used? <br /><br />Where did you purchase the 2 First Check Home Drug tests? <br /><br />What are the complete names of the 2 First Check Home Drug tests you used and the outer lot numbers and expiration dates (on the bottom of the boxes)? <br /><br />Also, what are the complete names of the 2 First Check Home Drug tests you used and the inner lot numbers, item numbers and expiration dates (on the foil pouches)? <br /><br />At what temperature were the test kits stored? <br /><br />How much urine was in each collection cup? <br /><br />How long after the foil pouches were opened and the test lids were removed were the tests performed? <br /><br />Did you notice any damage to the foil pouches? Were the desiccants/pillow packs in the foil pouches? <br /><br />Was anything removed from the test lids? <br /><br />Were the test lids twisted securely onto the collection cups and rested on the test legs on a flat surface for 5 minutes? <br /><br />Were the tests shaken or tipped upside down? <br /><br />Were the control lines a red or pink color and were there no THC drug lines between the 5 and 10 minute read time on both tests? <br /><br />Did the urine samples appear normal? What color were they? <br /><br />Were the samples fresh, body temperature urine and were they tested immediately after collection? <br /><br />Were they first morning urine samples? <br /><br />Could you please provide photos of the test lids / results? <br /><br />We look forward to hearing from you. <br /><br />Please respond to me via email at info@firstcheckfamily.com or call our toll-free Help Line at 1-888-788-5716. Our First Check Help Line Specialists are available to assist you, Monday through Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.

Not because my boss would frown upon me receiving a DUI but because the my state won't certify a person that has a DUI. In fact they will actually revoke your certification if you do. That being said, my BACtrack-Element Breathalyzer has been extremely reliable, accurate and has saved me from drinking and driving numerous times. For those of you that either have a BacTrac or are about to buy one I can tell you this. Most states have an offense called an APC (Actual Physical Control) where if you are in or near your vehicle with your keys and are intoxicated you can be arrested. Most states treat this just like a DUI when it comes to getting a Breathalyzer in your car. If you get one of these Bactracs which I recommend. DO NOT WAIT TO GET OUT TO YOUR CAR BEFORE YOU BLOW INTO YOUR BREATHALYZER! You want to see how high your BAC (Breath Alcohol Content) is before you go out to your car. All states you want your BAC level to be under .050 which is a DWI, the lighter version of a DUI which is .080, before you go out to your vehicle. I hope none of you will ever need my services and I can tell you that if you buy one of these you are far less likely to get an alcohol related driving offense."

Please educate yourself prior to use & follow the directions.

We sprang the test on the individual who wanted us to test him randomly. My hubby supervised so no water could be added to the urine or other test ""tampering"". The young man told us what would show up in his system & yes, the test caught it. It caught the Opiates/Heroin & it caught Meth.

His wife & us have purchased more of these tests to spring on him. His wife happened to goof one test by putting the cup down vertically instead of horizontally which she hurried to correct. The test showed he was clean but you cant really rely on it at that point. We retested with a new kit & we were happy to see he was clean!

*Please also check with your local Health Department. In our area, they do drug screens for not more money than this test. Their tests provide more information & cover a broader spectrum of drugs. But, with that being said, you can't really give them a ""pop quiz"" like you can with one of these tests at home.

My heart goes out to addicts & their families/loved ones. There are options out there to help - even if you have no income.

God Bless."

First Check Case # 1026915<br /><br />Dear Maurice,<br /><br />Thank you for contacting First Check Diagnostics regarding our Home Drug Test Product Line. We appreciate your business and value your feedback. We are happy to address any questions or concerns you may have with our First Check products. <br /><br />In response to your email, the result is Preliminary Positive on the First Check Home Drug Test when No line appears next to the word Drug and a red or pink colored line appears next to the word Control between the 5 and 10 minute read time. A Preliminary Positive Screening Result on the First Check Home Drug Test means that either the level of drug detected on the home portion of the test is above the cut-off level of the test or a substance, such as an over-the-counter medication or prescription drug, may be cross-reacting to cause a Preliminary Positive Result. We recommend that you send all Preliminary Positive samples to our laboratory for free, confidential, confirmatory testing, per the instructions in our package insert. <br /><br />The First Check Home Tests are at least 99% accurate; however, it is possible that another test could be testing for something else or have a different cut-off level for the drug tested for. Also, we cannot guarantee the result on another test for several reasons: <br /><br />Each urine sample could contain different amounts of the drug because of: <br /><br />• The way the body clears the drug and a person’s metabolism. <br />• How much fluid you drank (how hydrated you are). Did you use first morning urine? <br />• How much of the drug was taken, the type of drug and the frequency of use. <br />• When the drug was taken in relation to testing. <br />• How close to the cut-off level the drug was in your urine sample. Samples near the cut-off level provide the greatest margin of error. <br />• If you plan on retesting, we recommend that you use first morning urine to ensure the most concentrated sample and limit the amount of fluids you are drinking. <br /><br />Did you send the 2 samples that you tested on the 2 different First Check Home Drug tests to our laboratory for free, confidential, confirmatory testing, per the instructions in our package insert?  If so, could you please provide the Sample ID #s of the 2 samples that you sent to our laboratory for free, confidential, confirmatory testing? <br /><br />Could you please provide the complete names of the 2 First Check Home Drug tests you used and the dates that you performed each of the tests? <br /><br />Could you please provide the name of the test performed at that the lab you went to?  And, could you please provide the sample type used? <br /><br />Where did you purchase the 2 First Check Home Drug tests? <br /><br />What are the complete names of the 2 First Check Home Drug tests you used and the outer lot numbers and expiration dates (on the bottom of the boxes)? <br /><br />Also, what are the complete names of the 2 First Check Home Drug tests you used and the inner lot numbers, item numbers and expiration dates (on the foil pouches)? <br /><br />At what temperature were the test kits stored? <br /><br />How much urine was in each collection cup? <br /><br />How long after the foil pouches were opened and the test lids were removed were the tests performed? <br /><br />Did you notice any damage to the foil pouches? Were the desiccants/pillow packs in the foil pouches? <br /><br />Was anything removed from the test lids? <br /><br />Were the test lids twisted securely onto the collection cups and rested on the test legs on a flat surface for 5 minutes? <br /><br />Were the tests shaken or tipped upside down? <br /><br />Were the control lines a red or pink color and were there no THC drug lines between the 5 and 10 minute read time on both tests? <br /><br />Did the urine samples appear normal? What color were they? <br /><br />Were the samples fresh, body temperature urine and were they tested immediately after collection? <br /><br />Were they first morning urine samples? <br /><br />Could you please provide photos of the test lids / results? <br /><br />We look forward to hearing from you. <br /><br />Please respond to me via email at info@firstcheckfamily.com or call our toll-free Help Line at 1-888-788-5716. Our First Check Help Line Specialists are available to assist you, Monday through Friday from 8:30 A.M. to 5:00 P.M.
