Please educate yourself prior to use & follow the directions.

We sprang the test on the individual who wanted us to test him randomly. My hubby supervised so no water could be added to the urine or other test ""tampering"". The young man told us what would show up in his system & yes, the test caught it. It caught the Opiates/Heroin & it caught Meth.

His wife & us have purchased more of these tests to spring on him. His wife happened to goof one test by putting the cup down vertically instead of horizontally which she hurried to correct. The test showed he was clean but you cant really rely on it at that point. We retested with a new kit & we were happy to see he was clean!

*Please also check with your local Health Department. In our area, they do drug screens for not more money than this test. Their tests provide more information & cover a broader spectrum of drugs. But, with that being said, you can't really give them a ""pop quiz"" like you can with one of these tests at home.

My heart goes out to addicts & their families/loved ones. There are options out there to help - even if you have no income.

Each kit comes with 10 semen detection tests that can be used on multiple items of clothing. Simply take the garment and use the included blotting papers and dropper to determine if semen is present. If the test paper changes color to purple, the garment has tested positive for semen and there is good reason to believe a spouse has been unfaithful.

Performing the infidelity test only takes a few minutes and doesn't leave any marks or residue on the clothing.

Each drug is cleared by the body at different rates. Some drugs, for example marijuana, can stay in the body for up to several weeks after use. <br /> <b>How accurate are EZ Level Marijuana THC At Home Drug Tests?</b> <br />EZ Level drug testing products are more than 99 percent accurate in detecting specific drugs in urine. The accuracy of the test depends on several factors such as how close to the cut-off level the drug is in your urine, how soon the test was administered after ingesting a drug, and how much of the drug was used or ingested.","Product delivered a day early.
