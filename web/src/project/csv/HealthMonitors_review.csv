They wouldn't let me because I made the purchase through Walmart.com, so I got a refund instead. Probably a good thing because I purchased an Omron 10 at Walgreens and it seems to be much more accurate.

Well, every morning I check my BP and pulse. My BP is normal to below normal and my pulse runs 50-52. So, my heart-rate is not so scary at 48 BPM at 6am when I'm barely awake.

So I did some homework and found this particular brand of a wrist cuff to be the most dependable and accurate.

HealthMonitors,Walmart #  4073582,Omron 7 Series Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Omron-7-Series-Wrist-Blood-Pressure-Monitor/15702123,"I met the Omron series of blood pressure monitors in a doctors office. While I do not know if they used the series 7 which I purchased, the model they used was used exactly as I use the one I purchased.
I had planned on checking its accuracy when I went to a doctor's appointment where that doctor's assistant uses the cuff, but I forgot to bring it.
However the readings I have gotten are within what I would expect.
This device is easy to use. Its put on your wrist, turn it on , you then move your wrist toward your heart.
The device shows when you are close to your heart by changing the color of a light. The wrist device then inflates and gives a reading.
It comes with both easy start instructions and a more comprehensive booklet.
Note: Beware of other brands of wrist monitors. The first one I purchased was very inaccurate.
I do not think it inflated nor did it have a heart sensor.
Final advice is to use the on-line order with store pick up for best price."

I needed a blood pressure cuff that would be easy and convenient as my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be. The digital readout is very clear and the numbers are large. Being a retired Registered Nurse myself, I was wondering if this unit would be accurate. Come to find out, all the visiting nurses were using the same model and had total confidence in their readings when compared with the old standard BP cuffs. What's nice about this device is that it alerts you if their is an irregular heartbeat which was what I was needing to know with my mom. It also lets you know if their is movement that could cause a faulty reading and thereby you would want to check it again. And if that wasn't enough, it keeps an internal log in case you forget to write down your numbers which I have done as well! What amazed me the most is now that my mom is going to her own home, she can monitor herself with ease as its simple to put on your wrist. All in all I would have given it a 5 star but I havent had it that long to know if it will keep up its performance over the long haul. Buy this product. Its worth every penny!"

This had good reviews and it was easy and convenient to order online and pick up in the store. It was ready to pick up in less than 2 hours. This is a great value and brings a piece of mind too. I recommend this product. It has a few features like it stores the readings and gives you an average of morning and evenings and lets you know if you have hypertension. It seems to be accurate however I have not compared the accuracy of this blood pressure machine to the one at the doctors office. I don't give it 5 stars because the cuff could be made better and more comfortable. The box says the ComFIt (TM) cuff fits standard and large arms but the cuff is not flat and if you have a large arm the cuff cuts into your arm a bit. And the monitor stores memory but it only stores memory for one person. So when I use it, it averages my blood pressure with my husbands so that feature is useless to us. I have a chart and I write down the blood pressure anyway. This is our first Blood Pressure Monitor that we have purchased and it is serving it's purpose."

HealthMonitors,Walmart #  567171828,Omron Evolv Bluetooth Wireless Upper Arm Blood Press  ...,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Omron-Evolv-Bluetooth-Wireless-Upper-Arm-Blood-Pressure-Monitor/326384298,"I am very happy with the actual hardware part (4 stars). Very convenient form factor (no tubes to deal with). Arm placement is less critical, compared with my old monitor; unusually high results are infrequent (perhaps once every 8-10 times). Also had good results when I tested the calibration at my doctor's office (3 Omron readings vs. 2 manual readings). My only HW complaint is you can't retrieve results, or handle multiple users, unless you use the Bluetooth because of the lack of buttons and display.

The 1 star review is because of the lack of privacy when using the Bluetooth feature and association software. All of your BP results, along with your verified email, your precise GPS location when using the app, and any other info you put into the app, are sent to Omron and another company called Alivecor. There is no provision to opt out of this data collection, and they only notify you about this data collection in the middle of a large terms and conditions documents. They do provide a few opt-out choices once they have your data, but there is no way to opt-out altogether.

They did not have to design the system this way, they could easily made the BP results private to just your phone. There is no reason the app needs to access GPS location! It is quite sleazy that Omron/AliveCor doesn't clearly reveal that they upload your BP results to their servers. The lack of an option to disable uploads tells you the rest of the story. I'm not sure if it violates HIPPA, but it definitely violates the upcoming European GPDR privacy laws. 

Health data is very valuable, and I don't want to involuntarily contribute mine. Even if I trusted Omron and AliveCor with this data (and I don't), there are too many ways it can fall into the wrong hands (hackers, company gets acquired, etc.). This is not how a reputable Medical deceive company should operate!  

If the privacy concerns have not deterred you, here are some other SW problems that also would have reduced the rating of the product:
1) There is no way of seeing past readings, except by using bluetooth. 
2) The ability to review data is limited, very difficult to do things like comparing morning vs. evening results. It is also inconvenient to extract data from the app. 
3) Handling of multiple users for a single machine is clunky. Basically each person has to upload results to their app before the other person can use the monitor."

The Omron 10 series blood pressure monitor with its three stage system gives the user a truly accurate reading. The machine takes three separate readings with each use then averages the three to give the patient true numbers to manage medication well.

Not all machines do the  average sequencing testing method thus can give questionable readings. If the user is serious about understanding  their situation this is the monitor that can put control of their reality effectively. 

It is easy to put our heads in the sand hoping that progressive disorders and diseases will some how magically go away. The truth is we can manage so many issues by knowing the truth and working a plan to reinforce our lives. Good luck to you."

The digital readout is large, clear, gives the date, time and whether you are person 1 or 2.  I particularly like that the monitor gives a red or green indicator for the SYS and the DIA measurement.  If the reading is in range, you get a green light; a red light indicates out of range. This monitor will take 3 successive readings and give you the average of the three.  This too is a useful feature.  It is very user friendly and was easy to set up.  My only suggestion to the manufacturer would be to include a little case for the OMRON BP monitor.  Excellent choice.

Recently I had to purchase a new cell phone which I learned the Bluetooth was incompatible. Apparently the BP786N will work with my phone. I don't have budget to buy another unit to find out. The companion Omron Wellness app and associated website worked quite well, but would occasionally present difficulty making the Bluetooth transfer. Since my phone wasn't connecting with Bluetooth I could login on my wife's phone to make the data transfer. Fortunately Omron presented the Omron Connect app to replace the Omron Wellness app. This made things worse. Once I upgraded to this app I could no longer use my wife's phone to make transfers either. Now I get to enter all my blood pressure readings manually. A new graph is presented having no legend to tell what the markers mean. While I can see the last month of readings on the graph (a month back from today's date rather than the last calendar month like Omron Wellness) the year graph presents monthly averages three months at a time. Yes, that's right, a maximum of three months, one set of systolic and diastolic dot on the screen for each of three months to represent the past year. Then there is no easy to find location to report problems like this from the app or from their associated website. And speaking of websites the previous user related website where you could review your readings and custom see and print blood pressure results is now gone. You need to be well versed in Excel spreadsheets to download the data and figure it out. Further you must purchase the Kardio unit to get average resting heart rate. Apparently the Blood Pressure unit that measures heart rate with the blood pressure is an unreliable source of resting heart rate, maybe not. But you cannot record heart rate from it to be displayed. Heart rate was always available with the original Omron Wellness app graphs. Also, the Omron Connect app only connects to Google Fit this alienating Fitbit and Garmin users, especially those which already have constant heart rate monitors. And Google Fit app rates lower than the Fitbit and Garmin Connect apps. Google Fit does connect with Strava, but Strava which connects to Fitbit, Garmin, and others doesn't transfer steps let alone heart rate data. But take heart (yes, pun intended). Maybe within a year or two these kinks can be worked out and anyone still using the apps and can afford the new blood pressure units and Kardio units may have a useful app. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

You can transfer your readings over every week or so to your smartphone over bluetooth, easy. I think it remembers a hundred measurements or more so you could probably just transfer once every month or two. The app shows your readings over time and can send them to your doctor straight from your phone. I had no idea these little things had gotten so sophisticated. Very cool.

We each have an Omron wrist monitor and they are very accurate. He had to go to the ER recently when our monitor indicated a dangerous BP. Our reading was actually same as the one at the ER. Glad to say he was able to come home after few hours and we are both doing well. Our Omrons are life savers!!!! Everyone should have one to monitor their BP since checking every few months in the Dr office is not enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

She loves it and carries it in her purse; she reports she has used it many times and has even checked the O2 sats and pulse for others. I saw the pulse ox for the first time yesterday and it has a very nice cushioned finger grip which makes the device very comfortable to use. There's also a button to press to flip the parameter identifier: SpO2 or PR so it appears upright and easily readable whether on the right or left hand. The oximeter shuts off automatically when not in use. It comes with a nice velcro flapped case that has a loop to slide on a belt, as well as a plastic loop and lanyard to wear around the neck.

I have been on oxygen for a year now and it's worth testing yourself to see how much your o2 level drops just from doing something simple like sitting ( 02 reading in the 90's ) to getting up and walking outside bending over once and walking back inside, sitting down and testing again ( 02 reading in the 70's ).

I do agree with the previous review on this site that the head swivel is also too loose, and it moves making difficulty for listening. But now I can't use it at all!!

I have to say “Disappointed” for my Littmenn Cardiology IV. The material of Cardio III is a lot stronger and higher quality. For the Cardio IV, Quality is missing!

I finally decided to break down and buy one, but only a series 1 since I was kind of on a budget for one thing, and second I'm just a simple person so any features added to other models above the series 1 I felt I really don't need (yet). I didn't think I would have as much fun with it as I have been, it monitors everything I do from standing to walking and the call quality is also great. I find myself trying to meet the goals that I'm able to customize for standing, walking and things like that. I love the emergency features for when I'm walking alone or just in general being alone some place, there are so many cool things it does. I'm still learning how to use it, but will report anything weird or downsides if any come along in the future. If your looking for an Apple Watch I suggest you get one! If you have means get the higher series, if you are on a budget the series 1 is just as cool. I also went with a 38mm vs the 42mm because a family member has a 42mm series 2 and it was just to big on my wrist, so the 38mm seems to be a better fit for me. The only thing I don't like is the feel of the silicone band that it comes with, it's just uncomfortable for me.

I have never hit or dropped the watch ever, the crystal simply fell out of the watch, This apple watch is very expensive especially considering it only lasted a few months before it failed.

This precision scale weighs up to 400 pounds.  Its tempered glass and white in color.  The scale has a wide screen LCD which makes it easy to see and read. It has four high precision GX sensors to weigh in pounds, KG or ST increments.  I like the step on activation which captures the weight measurements upon stepping on the scale.  The auto turn off is a great feature to conserve battery life.  The scale operates on a lithium 2032 battery which is included.  A scale that is chic in style and accurate in readings.  The scale is simple to use.  The quality of Ozeri products never disappoint, only impress me.    It offers a sleek design.  With six people in our house, weight varies, so this is the perfect scale in my house.  I would recommend this scale in a heartbeat.  The scale goes with any décor and looks very classy in the bathroom.  I use the scale on a tile floor and it does not rock or move around.

There are four precision sensors that weigh up to 400 pounds in 0.2 lb increments.  You also have the option of displaying your weight in pounds or kilograms.  I like the ease and simplicity of this scale and put it in my upstairs bathroom for my kids to use.

It is extremely good value and simple to use once you figure out how to secure the cuff with one hand. Fits a wide range of arm sizes and was fine for me - I am a well-built woman. May be small for a large man. Measure around your arm before purchase and make sure that in the 8.7-16.5 inch range - mine was ~14 inches. I use regularly to monitor my BP and so far it seems to be well made and high quality but I have only had it for about 10 days. Came with batteries so that I could use it right away and it was easy to attach the cuff to the monitor. It is important to line up the artery mark with your little finger and not to put the cuff on too tightly - you should be able to put two fingers between your arm and the cuff when it is on properly.

My blood pressure was way out of hand now I feel I can control it if I can monitor . Great buy for the price 28.00 bucks not bad.

The only trick is to remember to keep it at your heart level when taking your blood pressure.  I like the fact that it doesn't tighten so hard that you feel like your arm is going to break off, like with the arm blood pressure monitor!"

And then you wait 5 mins. Retake it and get totally different readings. Wanted to see how accurate it was tried at least 4 times waited 5 min.between uses not even close to the same readings. And yes I had it on properly and sat very still.

This cuff is inaccurate and so hard for one person to put it on.  Was about 10-15 points off of what my normal blood pressure is.  Each time I would do this with the help of my husband, I would get a totally different reading.  Do Not Buy This Product!!!"

One minute I was dead the next I was going to die.  Results were all over the chart.
