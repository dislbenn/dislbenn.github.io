Consistent readings (wait for the display to blink 3 times while it arrives at a measurement).  Self-calibrates (be sure to let it re-calibrate if moved).  Works well on a semi-hard linoleum floor with a wood substrate.  Teeters on its feet when moved to an uneven surface but seems to self-adjust the feet after stepping on it again and no longer teeters.  Easy to read display.  I like having the stainless skin over glass, adds a level of non-slip confidence compared to glass top models plus it's less prone to scattering bits if the glass underlayer were to break.

Cons:  My only con is the platform is fairly small.  I would have given it 5 stars if it were larger."

Embedded with StepOn technology, it automatically powers on upon contact and features 4 touch sensitive buttons for easy operation. It also features 4 icons that automatically illuminate on the screen for body fat, hydration, muscle and bone measurements. The Ozeri Touch includes built-in memory for up to 8 user profiles with auto recognition technology for shared use at home, the office or the gym. Each profile stores weight, gender, height, and age data so that your family members can each track their progress. The Ozeri Touch Total Body Scale combines advanced algorithms with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), incorporating a person's age, height, gender and weight, for its accurate measurements. BIA is a well-established and respected method used to estimate body fat and hydration. Muscles, blood vessels and bones are body tissues with a relative high water content which conducts electricity easily. Body fat is tissue that on the other hand displays much less electric conductivity. With BIA, the Ozeri Scale sends a weak and harmless electrical current through your body to determine the amount of fat tissue. This weak electrical current is imperceptible to the user, and returns back data that is used to instantly calculate the advanced measurements. The Ozeri Touch Total Body Scale displays all results on its easy to read high-contrast LCD screen with blue digits. It utilizes 4 latest generation GX sensors to capture weights up to 440 lbs (200 kg) with industry leading accuracy. With its innovative Tare feature, the Ozeri Touch Bath scale also eliminates all the stress with weighing an infant or pet. Simply step on the scale to record your weight, step off and back on again while carrying your infant or pet, and the scale accurately displays both weights on separate sections of its bright LCD. The Ozeri Touch Tare feature also works as a handy luggage scale so there are no unpleasant surprises at the airport, and it just as easily weighs parcels and boxes. It turns off automatically to conserve battery power, and runs on 2 included Lithium batteries for optimal performance. The scale is made of impact resistant tempered glass which is 4 times stronger than normal glass, and boasts a reflective surface and elegant design.",The digital display is pretty cool. The display is all touch and surprisingly all run on two tiny batteries! Sometimes I get on it and it gives me an estimate but when I step on it two more times the measurement is probably my actual weight. I haven't compared it to the scale at the VA Hospital yet but it seems like it might be the same or close to it. The instruction manual is easy to understand and has a bunch of different languages so should be easy for most to follow. The whole thing is pretty cool and techie and worth the thirty something dollars I spent on it! It says white but it seems more of a light creamish greenish color and so far that's my only tit or tat about it! Time will tell how it holds up and I'm grateful that I can find the replacement batteries online.

Whereas I'm moving away from my college where I'd normally do skin-folds as a way to get my body fat percentage, I decided to buy this scale to take the place of skin-folds although I'm aware that electronic readings tend to be off. With that said, I can confirm that this scale is WAY OFF.

When it comes to body weight itself, it's fair to say that it's within 1lb when it comes to accuracy. I stepped on it multiple times to make sure it was consistent. The problem, however, was every other reading. Specifically bodyfat and water weight percentages. Being 6 weeks out from my current show, my last skin-fold had me marked at 7% BF. This scale had me marked at 23.3% BF. This is a massive difference.

BMI was pretty spot on. At only 5'6 and around 172lbs, it was correct. I admire that they made a ""Normal"" and ""Athlete"" mode that is supposed to help you when it comes to daily calorie intake, but it's showing my suggested maintenance calories to be around 3100g which is untrue in all ways (It's over by about 1000g of calories).

All in all, I was really hoping this scale would AT LEAST be within 7% accuracy on the body fat percentage measurements, but the only thing on it that is accurate is the weight.

Sorry for the story, but I wanted to be as detailed as possible."

I wanted something reliable. I've tried the other digital glass scales. I didn't like that  they smudge with footprints and look dirty quickly. I don't need to know my bmi from a scale I've got gadgets for that. 
Another reviewer said that the needle didn't land on zero and they just lived with it like that. What they don't know is that there is a little calibration dial on the front of the scale. Turn it back to zero whenever it's off. Unless you are a professional athlete or someone that is obsessed with knowing your weight to the ounce you won't be disappointed. It looks nice too! 
Also, I found with the glass digital scales you can't stand them up if you want them out of the way, it messes with the calibration. (This scale you just turn the dial)"

The accuracy seems on par in comparison to an older scale (being replaced due to crack).  This is a more sleek and modern version scale.  The voice saying good by is interesting because of the delay and I find myself talking back.  It doesn't say hello though.  The only qualm I have it that the surface is slippery.  I have to take my slippers off or I can slip towards the wall.  I am surprised that a textured surface wasn't incorporated.  However, it is a minor detail overall.

I preferred a better scale and not this additional item which comes as part of the purchase. My old scale did not always set at 0 ... sometimes a pound or so under, others a pound or two less.
