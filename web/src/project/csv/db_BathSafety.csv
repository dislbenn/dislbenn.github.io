This bench also features built-in hand grip and tool-free assembly.","it took me a minute to figure out how to put this together after that the first experience with it was to notice how comfortable it is or either just to sit, unbelievable.
for the days when you not to sure about standing this has proved to be the right item to fix those very small worries. i would say it is of good quality as i have already said it is very stable does not wiggle like others i have seen. since i don't know everyone's needs i will only then say it was the right choice for me. the only problem you then have if you have a shower hand held wand, is wanting to leave the shower and massages."
