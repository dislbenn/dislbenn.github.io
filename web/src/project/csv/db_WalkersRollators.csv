Assembly was fairly easy and no tools were needed to do so. The weight of the walker itself is approximately 19 lbs. Depending of the need to actually lift the walker or load it, 19 lbs. was slightly heavy but manageable to me. The seat on the walker is right at 11 1/2""x 11 1/2"" inches, and the walker itself folds up for easy storage. According to the instruction manual, the maximum weight limit should not exceed 350 lbs. One thing to note is that the Medline Rolling Walker is completely latex free, so those with a latex allergy need not be concerned. The basket under the padded seat also measures at about 11 1/2""x 11 1/2"" inches, but the recommended allowed weight limit for the pouch is 10 lbs. or less. The basket is also removable. The rolling walker should never be used as a wheel chair as injury may occur. The height of the walker is fully adjustable. Always make sure your walker is fully opened before each use. The brakes lock by pulling down on the brake handles and making sure they click into the locked position. Always lock the brakes before attempting to be seated. Never use the walker to pull or lift yourself up as it may roll even when in the locked position. I find that the 6"" inch wheels allow the walker to roll very easily on tile, and concrete. When on carpet or grass I was also able to roll forward and backwards very easily, but I recommend being more cautious on rugs and in the yard. I found the Medline Rolling Walker to be very durable, comfortable, and very easy and helpful to use. Great product, but to avoid injury make sure to fully read ""All"" instructions and cautions provided to you in your manual.
