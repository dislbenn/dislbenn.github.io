Excelvan Touch 440 lbs Total Body Bath Scale – Measu  ...,$24.00,4.4/5.0,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Excelvan-Touch-440-lbs-Total-Body-Bath-Scale-Measures-Weight-Fat-Muscle-Bone-Hydration-with-Auto-Recognition-and-Infant-Tare-Technology/33412350,"Newly updated, the Excelvan Touch 440 lbs Total Body Scale now provides instant adult and infant weight measurements, and calculates body fat, hydration, muscle mass and bone measurements. Embedded with StepOn technology, it automatically powers on upon contact and features 4 touch sensitive buttons for easy operation. It also features 4 icons that automatically illuminate on the screen for body fat, hydration, muscle and bone measurements. The Ozeri Touch includes built-in memory for up to 8 user profiles with auto recognition technology for shared use at home, the office or the gym. Each profile stores weight, gender, height, and age data so that your family members can each track their progress. The Ozeri Touch Total Body Scale combines advanced algorithms with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), incorporating a person's age, height, gender and weight, for its accurate measurements. BIA is a well-established and respected method used to estimate body fat and hydration. Muscles, blood vessels and bones are body tissues with a relative high water content which conducts electricity easily. Body fat is tissue that on the other hand displays much less electric conductivity. With BIA, the Ozeri Scale sends a weak and harmless electrical current through your body to determine the amount of fat tissue. This weak electrical current is imperceptible to the user, and returns back data that is used to instantly calculate the advanced measurements. The Ozeri Touch Total Body Scale displays all results on its easy to read high-contrast LCD screen with blue digits. It utilizes 4 latest generation GX sensors to capture weights up to 440 lbs (200 kg) with industry leading accuracy. With its innovative Tare feature, the Ozeri Touch Bath scale also eliminates all the stress with weighing an infant or pet. Simply step on the scale to record your weight, step off and back on again while carrying your infant or pet, and the scale accurately displays both weights on separate sections of its bright LCD. The Ozeri Touch Tare feature also works as a handy luggage scale so there are no unpleasant surprises at the airport, and it just as easily weighs parcels and boxes. It turns off automatically to conserve battery power, and runs on 2 included Lithium batteries for optimal performance. The scale is made of impact resistant tempered glass which is 4 times stronger than normal glass, and boasts a reflective surface and elegant design.",The digital display is pretty cool. The display is all touch and surprisingly all run on two tiny batteries! Sometimes I get on it and it gives me an estimate but when I step on it two more times the measurement is probably my actual weight. I haven't compared it to the scale at the VA Hospital yet but it seems like it might be the same or close to it. The instruction manual is easy to understand and has a bunch of different languages so should be easy for most to follow. The whole thing is pretty cool and techie and worth the thirty something dollars I spent on it! It says white but it seems more of a light creamish greenish color and so far that's my only tit or tat about it! Time will tell how it holds up and I'm grateful that I can find the replacement batteries online.

Didn't use it regularly but now am trying to keep up with my weight for medical issues and the thing will not weigh properly. It varies as much as 10 pounds or more within only moments. I looked on the Fitbit forums to see if there was a solution and there are many MANY people complaining of the same issue and there told the same solution--which DOESN'T WORK.  So now, I have a useless piece of tech junk and am now in the market for a plain old reliable scale.
