Due to the fact that it's adjustable, it also works to help remind her (dementia) to stay in bed when she wakes up. It was easy to install.
Unfortunately, the bed is too low to the ground to be able to swing the rail down out of the way to get in and out of bed as it was intended, so it has to stay in the up position all the time. That's the reason this was the only bed rail I could find that works well for her situation. At it's shortest width, she can still easily get into bed. Once she's in it can be lengthened to provide her with the safety she needs. You simply push in a button to lengthen it. There are two buttons to provide customized lengths. The buttons are too difficult for my mom to push (a bonus due to the dementia), but they are easy for the caregivers to use.
The storage caddy also makes an easy place to hang the monitor for the bed alarm. It could also be a great place for glasses and a small book if someone wanted to read in bed."

It comes with a removable hypoallergenic soft cover for easy machine washing. This memory foam lumbar support cushion is also small enough to store almost anywhere when not in use.","I'm 5'7"" 130lbs, and I find that this lumbar support cushion is a little too thick to sit comfortably in my car, it pushes me so far forward that I can't lean my upper back on the seat. That being said, for that exact same reason, it's a miracle worker at my desk job. It forces me to sit up more and not slouch, which helps my back, it also pushes me forward on my office chair to be closer to my keyboard and thus, much more ergonomical to work. I think the strap on the cushion is WAY too short, it wouldn't fit over my car seat or my office chair ( I ended up cutting the strap and sewing on elastic bands to each side then using sew-on velcro to make it work, which was an extra 15"" of strap). So, although I had orginally bought it for the car, I think it's too thick, but for that same reason works wonders for posture and egronomics at my desk job."

Help is just seconds away with the world's smallest 2-way voice emergency pendant communicator.</p>,"After researching  several other  devices  such as the Freedom  Alert ,  I found  that for the money it could not be beat.. The purchase price is less than one would  pay if subscribing  to any other device for a year or less. Also no installation  or activation  fees.
One of the things that really impressed me was the 2 way communication ,  that works thru the pendant, so I  can be anywhere within 600 feet of the base  and be able to call for help, either  by calling any contact I program in or 911. I particularly  liked the fact it calls 911 instead  of  a call center located who knows where, which could take more  time.
I have tested it in all parts of my home, basement to second floor and the perimeter  of my yard with excellent  reception . 
Luckily I have had no emergency sine receiving but feel confident  it will be  there and do its job."

It was set on the lowest setting so it could not go any lower.  Even when I put some cushions in her chair to raise her up, the desk  top  was still too high (not to mention that she had difficulty sitting down on the stack of cushions before being completely seated).

One other problem was that when I was disassembling the table,  the spring-loaded pin (for the height adjustment) popped down into the cylinder on one side and was only accessible through the other side.

The concept for the table is good, but these problems made it unworkable for our needs."
