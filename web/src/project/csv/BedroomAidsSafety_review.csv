This Medline bed assist bar is really super helpful in more ways than one.
I can pull my wheelchair up to the bed and instead of using my one good leg to make a leap for the bed I can now grab hold of the handle of the bed assist bar and swing to the bed. LOL it sounds funny but it's bad when you only have one semi good leg and 1 semi good arm, so you do what you have to do. Anyway I canhold on to it when I lay down and it is super helpful when I want to sit up. There is also a magazine/paper holder on the side so if I don't want to get out of bed for a book or whatever since it's so hard I just have to reach around to get it.
It says in the directions that it's not for keeping people in bed from rolling out however I roll out and it has kept me in and I weigh 175 so that really is another good point.
It is a light brown and very light weight, there is 1 piece goes all the way under the mattress up to a queen size and then there is a strap to further secure it so it's not going anywhere and neither are you.
This is a quality product."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  554671622,Medline Tool-Free Bed Assist Bar with storage bag,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Medline-Tool-Free-Bed-Assist-Bar-with-storage-bag/21782273,"I wanted this item because my 90 lb mother in law was staying with us while recovering from heart surgery. She was weak and fragile and also unsteady. This was perfect for helping her position herself into and out of bed. The item needs some assembly but it all snaps together with push buttons so it needs no tools. We had it adjusted to the bed and ready to use in 5 minutes. The hook on bag was perfect for her tablet, book and glasses so she could reach them without twisting in bed. The top is a soft foam and allows a good grip without slipping. The rubber feet also are great. at my house there is a carpet so it wasn't much of an issue but i plan to send it home with her and she has hard wood flooring. Both the top bar and legs are adjustable so it can be a lower handle or a higher bed and still work perfectly. It comes with a strap to strap the bar that slides under the mattress to the mattress itself but I didn't use that since she is so small she couldn't have moved it anyway. This is great for her and will be great at home for my mother in law since she is 80 yrs old and we worry about her safety but I can see this would be awesome for hip or knee surgery recovery as well. I would even see it as a super item for someone with a broken leg, knee or foot issue where you might want just a little assistance without calling for help all the time."

It does require assembly but the included directions are somewhat easy to understand and it simply snaps together. It seems to be pretty sturdy and can support you well when leaning on it to stand up out of bed. The center bar simply slides in between your mattress and box spring on most beds. There is a metal loop on the end of the center bar and a long nylon strap that attaches to it and you then loop the strap around the opposite bed rail to prevent the Assist Bar from sliding out accidentally. I tried it without the strap and it's still pretty secure but I do recommend securing it properly with the strap to the opposite bed rail. The legs have rubber feet to prevent it slipping and they can be height adjusted to fit how tall your bed is. The top grab handle has foam padding around it and is easy to hold on to. It too can be adjusted for height. I adjusted it just a few inches off the mattress top so she could swing her legs over it, with it positioned toward the foot of the bed. There is also included a small mesh pouch for storing miscellaneous items you might keep around your bed. Overall, it's well designed, sturdy, safe and it seems to be really helping my parent stand up when getting out of bed. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone with knee problems or even if you just want something secure to grab onto, to help you get on your feet in the morning."

Due to the fact that it's adjustable, it also works to help remind her (dementia) to stay in bed when she wakes up. It was easy to install.
Unfortunately, the bed is too low to the ground to be able to swing the rail down out of the way to get in and out of bed as it was intended, so it has to stay in the up position all the time. That's the reason this was the only bed rail I could find that works well for her situation. At it's shortest width, she can still easily get into bed. Once she's in it can be lengthened to provide her with the safety she needs. You simply push in a button to lengthen it. There are two buttons to provide customized lengths. The buttons are too difficult for my mom to push (a bonus due to the dementia), but they are easy for the caregivers to use.
The storage caddy also makes an easy place to hang the monitor for the bed alarm. It could also be a great place for glasses and a small book if someone wanted to read in bed."

My mother has dementia and bad knees. At night she would drift around the house and fall or fall out of bed. I wanted to prevent this from happening. I needed something easy yet reliable to keep her in bed.

This product is great, it is versatile (can be used on either side of the bed). It is safe, reliable to manage and easy to install. I was able to assembly myself without any trouble and she has not fallen since I installed it on her bed. She also uses the potty chair and I just lower the rails by pushing a button and there you go, she is ready to get out of bed with my assistance. It is so great that it extends to 42 inches, so it covers from shoulders to feet. It has a compartment for items, but I like it for a bumper guard.

This is a great item and will save my mom from injuring herself. I am so pleased and happy with this product. I would recommend to anyone in need. It is sturdy and reliable. Very Pleased.

The only drawback was I had to assemble it myself. There aren't any pictures, except those on the box, so if you don't know the name of each part (not given), it's not as easy as you would think to determine which part goes where, even though you don't need any tools (and I have Bachelors degree in Mathematics).

I got it together eventually, so it isn't impossible. Oh, there was one other thing that wasn't quite right -- the handle rail from the floor to under the box spring was too long, so it is not floor level (sticks up crooked) and can't be any lower."

They are extremely helpful in helping people maintain their independence with bed mobility. It's very sturdy.  The only problems I've encountered are when the box spring was a shorter height andvthe frame was low to the floor. It didnt fit. Other than that, it has fit most standard beds and the new deeper mattresses. It will not work on an adjustable bed where the head of the bed goes up and down. I would also suggest installing it higher toward the top of the bed, so it doesn't impede ones ability to get in/out without having to scoot."

Even though floor-mount bed rail products say they fit MOST mattresses none of the floor-mounts we researched would fit our box spring height from the floor.  This under-the-mattress mounted bed rail solved the problem of not having to have a floor-mount bed rail.  We bought two rails -- one for each side of the bed and we both find the rails very helpful for getting out of bed or for holding onto something sturdy while turning over in bed.  No more worries about falling out of bed either when we feel the rail.  We did not use the mattress security straps for the rails as we did not find them necessary -- the rail undersides are long in length and quite secure between the mattress

that holds the strap in place is plastic and got stripped out easily.  Plastic on metal is never a good idea, this knob needs to be made of metal just like the rest of it.  I also 
believe there should be padding on the whole rail not just parts of it.  There are also 
a few unfinished metal places on the bars that are sharp and could cut someone.  It takes two people to install on the bed, one to hold the mattress up, and one to install

The bedcane stays securely in place under the mattress and does not move when she uses it to pull herself up out of her bed. With the cane adjusted to the tallest setting, it is the correct height for my mother's standard size mattress. This cane would not work for pillowtop or thicker mattresses. The handle is not completely stationary. It does move some. This is not a problem and may reduce stress on the wrist.

A word of caution - my mother's physical therapist recommended we buy this type bedcane for my mother to use. However, the assisted living facility where my mother resides has now informed me that the physical therapist was wrong. This bedcane does NOT meet their safety requirements.

He is able to pull himself upright and use the handle like a cane when he stands up. Being able to lean on the handle a few moments to get good balance before moving away from the bed is all he needed. Because he is blind, the bed cane also has the added benefit of giving him something to line-up next to so he enters the bed at the proper height. He likes to put his cellphone and emergency call button in the pouch before he goes to sleep, which is convenient. I was worried the thickness of the wood base would feel lumpy and the way the cane attaches to the wood base is a bit wobbly, but my father-in-law has not expressed any concerns about those two things.

And it's just perfect for what I needed and couldn't be more happy could not live without it. I can move around in bed easily and I can sleep knowing I'm safe. And it is well made and strong I'm a big man and I can pull myself to turn in bed and it doesn't budge. I am very happy with it.

She has not moved while sleeping however, the past weekend I found her on the floor and very cold. My guess is she had been there for at least two hours!!!!

The Sander's Safety Rail has been a God sent!! The locking pins on either side are easy to open and close. There are no parts to irritate mom arms or hands. Provides more than enough space to make the bed. Easy assembly, tools are included and set up for one person.

I purchased a similar rail from a major company paying over $100.00 more. It was difficult to operate and set up! I highly recommend the Sander's 30"" Pivoting Safety Rail!!

Sincerely,

So, a notation of that possible problem with traditional beds could have been mentioned in the item description.

Walmart could not have been nicer about the return however.

Notably first, it is made by Medline which has been a trusted name in healthcare supplies and the largest in the US since 1910. They are known for using high quality materials in their products.
This product has microban which is built right into the product's non slip seat and backrest. The microban protection repels bacteria, mold and mildew and odor. The protection lasts a lifetime.
The product allows the bather to sit on the seat outside the tub area and simply and safely slide into the tub area. The bather can sit on the seat while using a hand held spray or use the seat for stability when sitting down into the tub.
The bench has 2 suction cup feet which securely hold the bench to the tub floor. The other two legs have non slip protectors. The legs are adjustable to make up for the difference in height from the outside to the inside height of the floor. This design is superior in safety than the small seats which only fit in the tub.
The product itself is lightweight but sturdy. The seat is wide enough for a large person and can hold up to 300 pounds. The seat back can be moved to allow for either left or right entry in the tub. The price is a value for the safety protection this product has."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  552604507,Medline Transfer Bench with Back & Microban,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Medline-Transfer-Bench-with-Back-Microban/37617767,"Once again, Medline has scored a hit with the transfer bench; this assistive device is lightweight, easy to assemble and has many features which make it quite desirable to those requiring help with transferring from one surface/place to another and trying to maintain independence.

The seat of the bench is comfortably wide and deep and can withstand weight up to 300 lbs. The seat back allows not only a place to lean back but also offers another means of grip and support as well as the built-in grab bar.

Adequate research and engineering skill were employed when including wide, capable suction cups to both feet on one side of the bench, thereby allowing the bench to be secured to the floor of a tub or shower. As expected, height of the seat can be adjusted by moving the clips on the legs up or down.

The necessity for the material to be latex-free is a new development over the past few years, but is included on this device as well as a Microban impregnation to provide antimicrobial protection and mold/mildew inhibition.

Except for the fact that the bench would be difficult to store in a closet, it is an excellent means for providing much-needed assistance and a measure of independence to those individuals who may be either temporarily or permanently mobility-challenged, whether due to rheumatoid arthritis, amputation, recent lower extremity surgery or simply just as an aid in getting into and out of the tub for those who may have trouble with balance and weight-bearing.

In all, a very good product, no less than I would expect from an industry leader like Medline."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  552604507,Medline Transfer Bench with Back & Microban,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Medline-Transfer-Bench-with-Back-Microban/37617767,"I'm about midline in my review of this shower bench. It is very easy to assemble and has a lot of holes for height adjustment. And for a bench to be so sturdy and weight bearing, it is SO lightweight! A little bulky for my bath, but so very easy to lift and move unless the suction is in place. The suction cups work extremely well. I don't think I would have to put it to the test, but I can fairly say that I'm sure this bench is durable for the long run. I really like this bench, but I'm unable to use it in my bathroom. If you have a small bathroom like I have, make sure the bench will fit. It is just too difficult to move around without it being in my way. It also interferes with my shower doors, and I'm just not ready to remove them yet. I thought I could place it on the back end of the tub with a modified temp curtain during use, but my tub is too curved at this end. And to adjust for the difference in the tub height versus floor makes it more difficult for me to use. The box shows that one set of legs have the suction cups and the other doesn't, but my bench has a regular leg and a suction cup leg on both sides. But I think it probably makes it more secure that way. The bench sits 19"" high on lowest end. As I said, I just can't keep it in the bathroom, I tried twice and moved it out. But because I really like it I found the perfect spot for it to be useful for me. I moved it to my backyard porch. This bench has a nice soft color and it's not an eye sore to look at, it fits fine out there. It is a great sturdy chair that makes it easy for me to use the rail to steady sitting and standing and because of the coating, it doesn't mold and mildew and can withstand the weather. So now it is my new outside chair and I spend way more time outside anyway! People should consider one of these to use outside, it's so much better than any other chair I have. So in closing, the bench doesn't work out for the bath, but it is a great product and works out as a great chair on my porch! I would recommend this bench just make sure of the size of the tub and room. The chair is around 29"" from grab bar to end of bench, and 21"" from foot to back rest bars."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  552604507,Medline Transfer Bench with Back & Microban,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Medline-Transfer-Bench-with-Back-Microban/37617767,"The transfer bench is very easy to assemble. All four legs are adjustable; they have snap buttons for height adjustment. For a bench to be so sturdy and weight bearing, it is also lightweight making it very easy to lift and move unless the suction is in place. The suction cups work extremely well.
The bench can be set up for either left side or right side access. It is easy for me to use the built in rail to steady myself while sitting and standing. It is a light blue color, it's been coated so it doesn't mold and mildew. This is a great product and works as a safe secure method of transfer to and from the shower. The tub transfer bench does not enable you to actually get down into the water, but it does allow you to be seated on the bench in the tub so you can use a hand-held shower.
I cut a couple of slits in the shower curtain to fit around the bench and had very little water on the floor. Just sit on the bench outside the shower swing your legs over the tub wall and slide across. Just be sure you can reach the water handles to turn off and on. A non slip mat is also a must."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  552604507,Medline Transfer Bench with Back & Microban,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Medline-Transfer-Bench-with-Back-Microban/37617767,I received this Midline Transfer Bench with back support and stability bar. I really like the concept and the chair looks really nice. It was super easy to put together and took me maybe ten minutes. I gave it a four because it really didn't work out the way I wanted. It was for my father in law that is over three hundred pounds. It says up to three hundred pounds. It wasn't that bad for the transfer but because it has two legs in the tub and two legs out of the tub made it hard for him to have the privacy of shower curtains. If you have a nice big shower it would be great. I like that it has the microban protection against stains and odor that's a big help. It has adjustable heights for the legs so you can adjust to meet you needs at the height you want so that is convenient. I think if you had a lighter person it would be great and that you don't mind have part of the chair hang out of the tub. I am a bit of a clean freak so that didn't sit well with me. I still think it was a great chair just didn't meet my needs for it. I would recommend just keep in mind my cons.
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  4025888,Carex Bed Rail Support,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Carex-Bed-Rail-Support/10105201,"Bought this for my 89 year old dad who was having difficulty getting up out of bed. We ended up turning the bottom leg sections upside down (pulled them out of the ""u"" shaped upright bar, took the rubber feet off and inserted them back into the ""u"" shaped upright bar 'end for end' and then put the rubber caps back on). In doing so, the unit would 'ratchet' high enough to fit his bed. If you used common sense, putting the unit together was not a problem. The enclosed instructions were, however, of little help. The rubberized bar provides for a good grip in which to pull yourself up to a sitting position. The nylon strap that attaches to the opposite side of the bed frame and the feet make this bed rail unbelievably sturdy. It is narrow enough that, when placed towards the head of the bed, allows for plenty of space to swing your legs to the side of the bed for easy exit. This bed rails met and exceeded the needs of my dad and I would highly recommend it for someone who needed assistance in getting out of bed."

It also protects his head if he starts to roll out of bed; and actually has kept him from rolling off the bed.

You can not feel the bars that slide between the mattress and box springs. Will purchase another one when the time comes that my mother needs one on her side of the bed."

I was surprised at how sturdy this support is. He feels safer going to bed at night and gives him a firm support to grab when he's getting in or out of bed. Easy assembled I'm extremely happy with this bed support and the price."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  4025888,Carex Bed Rail Support,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Carex-Bed-Rail-Support/10105201,"Many of the new mattresses are quite high which place us further from the floor. I was recently injured from a fall down a stairway. After my hospitalization, my physical therapist recommended this Carex Bed Support that I could purchase it at a medical supply business. After looking into the matter I thought of Walmart and found one on their website which was available at a lower price than at medical supply stores. It certainly eases my mind when getting in and out of the bed, being able to take hold of the handle as well as making it easier to turn over in bed. And I have no fear of falling out of bed since my bed with a new mattress is higher than it was."
BedroomAidsSafety,Walmart #  4025888,Carex Bed Rail Support,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Carex-Bed-Rail-Support/10105201,I got this because my 86 yr old mom would throw herself at the bed and sometimes miss or bounce off so I thought something to hold onto would help. It turns out it helps not as a grip but because of its presence she is more careful and now sits down. The parts fit very snugly and it is difficult to put together. Also the adjustable leg parts that touch the floor at first could not be adjusted down enough because the adjustment holes were too high but I figured out to pull them off and reverse them and then it worked just fine. If you are older or weaker be sure you have a strong young person around to put this together for you because it is difficult.

A work of CAUTION - in the assembly instructions you are instructed to remove a screw which releases the hydraulic pressure on the table upright. When you do this DO NOT be standing above the upright.

As this package arrived I asked that they take it to a neighbor as I didn't want it taken from my doorstep. It also allows my neighbor to say if the box is damage to refuse it. They did not take the delivery to my neighbor and yes, the box was damaged.

When we opened the package to install the rail, all that was there was the rail.
There was no frame to attach the rail to and there was not strap to attach it to the bed.
How can I help my parents meet the change of life. I needed it then and I had to ordered it from another store. It arrived as if I hadn't paid extra for shipping within a day, not like I did with you, but I LIKED your price and with the extra shipping it still wasn't their price.

Not only did I learn a lesson, as you can fool me once but never twice...
Thank you for the opportunity of trying your service once.

I would also like to give a word of thanks and praise to the person who did my credit on the card.
