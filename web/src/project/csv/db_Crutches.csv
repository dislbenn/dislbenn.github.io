It's machine washable and an easy way to keep your mobility device clean and comfortable.","I bought this pad because I had surgery which requires 'no weight' on my foot. I will be on the scooter for a few months. Although the original scooter seat is relatively comfortable this soft knee rest pad over the seat is soft, allows for sweat free scooting and eliminates the twisting of the knee skin when moving around.  The seat on my scooter is in two parts with a space in the middle for the cast lip. This pad does not hinder this function. This purchase was an excellent investment and I recommend it to those in a similar situation."
