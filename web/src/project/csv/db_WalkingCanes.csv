A word of caution... there are no instructions, so we had to learn these tips for ourselves:

1) remember to turn the base (where the four prongs are) depending on if you will use it on your LEFT OR RIGHT side.   One side of the base is a bit shorter than the other side ... and that is the side that is supposed to face inward towards your leg!  It gives you a bit more room for your foot so you do not trip on the cane.

2) there is a bolt/black twist ring on between the top and bottom halves of the cane (right by the adjustable pegs you move to size the cane up or down).  AFTER you have the cane set to the proper height with the pegs, make sure to TIGHTEN that bolt/ring.  It is a back up that holds the cane in place (from the inside) in case the little peg fails or becomes dislodged.   If you do not tighten that bolt/ring, the cane can collapse if the little peg is dislodged."
