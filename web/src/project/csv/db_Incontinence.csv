In light of the substantial leakage side to side, even if the manufacturer got their manufacturing processes under better control to properly and consistently center the absorbent part of the pads between the newly added useless and problematic “sides” it would make little improvement in leakage protection. They are not as thick or absorbent as the previous design which rarely leaked giving me the required confidence to live my life normally. The new sides added do not stand up enough to contain or direct the fluid back to the absorbent part of the pad. Instead the sides lay down (rather than stand up) allowing the fluid to easily flow over the sides, soaking panties and jeans then ultimately leaking down my legs.
