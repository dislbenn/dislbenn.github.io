It was very easy to put together and adjust to my size. I'm 5'8, 195 pounds and I don't find it small or confining as others have stated. I received the smaller batteries and already have found them to be more than adequate for my needs. Other companies charge twice the price and their batteries are rated for less distance than this one. I have yet to discharge the battery more than 1/4 capacity. The gauge has never fallen below the second green light. Yes, it has plastic wheels so you will feel a slight jarring when going over uneven pavement (the same as those free scooters at supermarkets), but the upside is that you don't have to watch tire pressure for inflatible tires; these should last a long time. The seat is comfortable. I went from early morning to late afternoon at a large two story mall and had no aches or pains. I cannot use the highest speed as those walking with me have said they can't keep up with me at high speed. I've taken it up steep ramps from an underground parking garage at a hospital with no problems. You do have to be careful when making sharp turns. No four wheel scooter is going to have the small turning radius as a three wheeler, but the stability more than makes up for this minor inconvenience. All in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this Drive scooter."

My son-in-law said it was easy to put together; however I can't comment on taking it apart as we haven't done that yet. My first reaction was to return it because I think it's too small for him (he is 6', 190 lbs. and there is VERY little room for his knees); however, since it isn't something he will be using every day, he decided to keep it.  Pay close attention to the specs; the highest setting for the seat is only 21 inches. The next model up only provides an additional 2 inches.  I contacted the company to see if I could purchase a higher seat post but they don't offer one and any modifications to the scooter void the warranty.   If you are tall, or have larger feet (my husband wears a size 10 shoe and his feet just fit) my suggestion would be to find a retailer in your area and “try it on for size” before purchasing. I gave it 4 stars because mechanically we've had no issues and it has given my husband the ability to get out and about in the neighborhood."

I slowly saw my active life going downhill and being stuck in the house with no normal life.  Insurance doesnt cover mobility scooters if you need outside the house mainly even if you have a lot of doctors appointments on a regular basis like myself. I did my research for over a month checking out other companies and units. Because paying out-of-pocket this was most reasonable even on a low budget. This model is normally over $900 to $1,700. From medical supplies companies. At first I thought there was something wrong with the pricing. But I called Drive Medical to make sure there wasnt a catch, that they are official equipment. The rep was amazed that the price was half the amount the medical supplies stores and providers have them for. But these come direct from Drive Medical. No going to the medical place or doctors to get it which saves you & your insurance. This is your item you own this. When going through Insurance it is only rented is not technically yours until i beleive mth 15. 

I put the scooter together myself it took a little longer than the two minutes due to being handicapped obviously. It was very easy besides tightening the seat nut and bolt. I had to find tool for that was just right. The only downfall was they didn't say you had to flip a knob on the front to get the wheels unlocked in the manual which is not Walmart's fault.

I took it for a test ride down to the shopping center 1.6 miles from my house it took me about 28 minutes because I had 3 main street lights to cross and a little down hill incline. Which the scooter handled well it would not handle much more of an incline going up. Which they do state limits for inclined. Went to a grocery store & a discount store which I was in about an hour going up and down the aisles. I was driving the scooter about 2 hours total before it was down to red lights. I did turn the power off while waiting at the stop lights as well as waiting in line at the grocery store I'm not sure if that would have wore the battery down more or if it helps but I was just trying it out. Lol the basket holds a decent amount of stuff and I also could put groceries on the floor. 

The fact that it's compatible it's perfect for trips I'll be taking it when I go to Niagara Falls verse rent one period when flying or taking a bus the luggage can go on the floor of the scooter so its better then a rolator or wheelchair. Is very handi. It charged very fast to the full power I want to say it took a few hours. But that's not bad since it went to fully powered.  I use a pillow for added comfort & height. 

The Paratransit busses have room for these and now I am able to get out of the house and do normal people activities which I couldn't do before I got this. I would struggle using a rollator in a wheelchair. A very good investment. Now I just need to either learn the hand signals or find signals to put on the back seat & basket. Lol  I will be buying the little light to put on the basket for night time. 

Drive Medical said they do cover the warranty just have to call them with the units number. I just don't know where to find that since it's not with the paper or in manual."

Cost of the Spitfire was only about half of the cost of the GoGo.  The Spitfire seat is a little smaller and not as thick.   It's wheels are a little firmer and these two factors give the Spitfire a little rougher ride.   Also, it's turning radious is a little less than the GoGo.  If these factors are worth paying double for you, then buy a GoGo.  Otherwise,  the Spitfire  is a vary good choice for a reasonable price.   Will probably buy another one if this one last 6 or 7 years like my GoGo did."

It rides very smoothly with the large rubberized wheels. The balance is really good and the ability to adjust the height of the handlebars and the seat is a major plus. The contour of the split seat adds to comfort.  The parking brake is very handy. At first I thought it unnecessary but I quickly learned the importance of it.
I have been using the knee walker for two weeks now and I am overall pleased with it. The turns are wide and sometimes I must lift the front to aim it but that is no big deal. This is needed only for sharp turns. The basket is a big plus. It is amazing how much we rely on little things we 'travel' with.
The big draw back is the wheel alignment to the handlebars. As stated in another review the front wheels are not aligned with the handlebars. They are off by about an inch which can be/is annoying. When aware of it one can compensate but given the purpose of the walker, to transport injured, hurting people I would think that this could have been corrected at the assembly plant since it plays a crucial role in recovery and has been reviewed by others. I tried to make the adjustment myself but the collapse section prevents me from loosening the bolt enough to move the handlebars into alignment. I am 61 years old and I'm going to see if my 82 year old dad will look at it to see if he can help fix it.
This is a nearly perfect knee walker. Roscoe should take action to correct this so that I and others can write that this is the perfect knee walker with a 5 star plus rating. With all of the pluses associated with this walker it shouldn't be too costly to correct it at the source so that Roscoe will be number 1 in my book."

Also, a five year warranty, including the batteries? Definitely my taste. Ordered quickly, and within 3 days, it was delivered!

The most difficult task was unpacking and removing all the bubble wrap. Assembled easily, however it did not immediately assemble correctly because I did not follow instructions on slipping seat in the receptacle. Found out that it did not seat fully, and seat was free turning. Disassembled and tried again until I got it right. Charged overnight, and following day we took it out. My wife loves it.

It is more solid feeling than her original scooter which was a three wheel.  This she can go out into the yard with no problem.  Climbs the ramp well into the house and goes easily over the threshold.   It is a little bit bigger turning radius than the other one.

It was a life saver.  It functioned as advertised.  It was easy to navigate in the airport, hotel, and ship.  It is not good on grass but excellent on pavement and in the house.  I also used it to attend football games and it worked great in the transit bus."

Too many times, there are none available, all being used, all broken, or all batteries dead.  So, I got this, and I could not be happier! The seat is the best part - it's SO comfortable - very sturdy and upright. I weigh 340 lbs, so the fact that it works so well with me is incredible! It can go pretty darn fast if you want it to, but the speed is very easily adjusted. The tiller can be unlocked to move forward for easy enter and exit. I don't have any trouble with looseness if I tighten the tiller very well. The seat will unlock to turn for easy entrance and exit as well. My sister assembles and and disassembles it easily for storing in trunk of car.  The battery is long lasting, and does not drop all at once like store carts. Really - you will LOVE this!"

Runs great only complaint is the steering is a little loose. The tiller can come out of the hands on cracks in the road. One just has to know that then no problems.

No problems with the scooter but I want a large rear basket for groceries.  The only one I can find and bought sticks way out in the rear.  Almost 2 feet from the back of the seat.  That would be too much to safely turn around.

Company will not answer the phone, you can't leave a message. The person who bought me the knee walker managed to talk to them once. He wants pics of the box and wheel and then he will think about replacing it.  So he has tried to contact them again multiple times their message box is full.  The size of the wheel is not stated in this add as in other ads the company has put wheel (caster) size in their ad. Measured the wheel it is 7 1/2 inches do they count that as an 8 inch wheel?  but it sounded like he would not replace the wheel."

Pros: it folds, I can get it in the car, it is fairly light weight, it is a comfortable ride.
Cons: Manual is lacking, the free wheel lever is not only hidden but useless unless you wan to turn the cart over (unusable when my mother is sitting in it) battery life could be better."
