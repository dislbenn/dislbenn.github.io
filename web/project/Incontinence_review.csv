The new design with sides is quite poor. Leakage occurs out the sides then SOAKS your panties and runs down your legs into your shoes. The pads have changed - not me. It's unbelievable Poise could consider this new design an improvement. These were obviously not tested long enough by women in the market. Do NOT buy this product expecting to be protected from leakage. I am now forced to look for a better product - one in which I can have some sort of confidence in. This new design is so poor that I am now back to either staying home or not hydrating sufficiently. Neither of those options is viable for the long term. Additionally, as a side note, I noticed last night that my packages of pads are all misaligned. The thick part of the pad is not centered side to side so I'm wondering if that's not part of the problem however I doubt it. In light of the substantial leakage side to side, even if the manufacturer got their manufacturing processes under better control to properly and consistently center the absorbent part of the pads between the newly added useless and problematic “sides” it would make little improvement in leakage protection. They are not as thick or absorbent as the previous design which rarely leaked giving me the required confidence to live my life normally. The new sides added do not stand up enough to contain or direct the fluid back to the absorbent part of the pad. Instead the sides lay down (rather than stand up) allowing the fluid to easily flow over the sides, soaking panties and jeans then ultimately leaking down my legs. Poor, poor redesign effort and not enough market testing as evidenced by the other reviews/complaints on this site."

Very uncomfortable, however, I tried the store brand and didn't care for it, so I've just been dealing with these.  My complaint this time is that the last time I bought a large package of pads I accidentally grabbed the Regular Length.  Ugh!!  Now I have 87 of those to use up, as I don't know anyone I can pass them on to, plus they're pretty expensive to just give away.  When I was in the store last time, I bought a small package of the Long Length, in case I needed the extra coverage when going out.  I noticed that the packaging, picture, and everything is exactly the same on both packages, with the exception of ""Long Length"" or ""Regular Length"" written in rather small, same color, print.  It's no wonder I made that mistake.  I would love to see the old product brought back, as well as better labeling on the packages to distinguish the differences much more easily.

The point is I have tried almost all brands and no brands out there and they are all the same and I learned that if you don't have the right size you will leak.
 Like I said I started of off with an size XL and even thou they were comfy they were too big and gave me a 50/50 chance into making it to the bathroom but I switched to a smaller size (large) and I don't leak anymore. I stayed with with this brand because they are comfortable, in a cute color and economical.

They are long, wide and very absorbent. I'm in a wheelchair all day and flat on my back all nite. I do not change them during the nite and I do have to lay on large chucks  to protect the bedding.  So I must be very aware of any possible skin issues. I wear them 24/7 and find them to be comfortable and effective.  My one wish is that they were a bit longer in back so that they didn't want to sit right over my tail bone.  Although they are quite flat it does add an extra point of possible  pressure  I try to avoid.  But this is perhaps only my issue.  I can adjust them to ride lower in front and higher in back or higher in front away from coccyx.  The absorbent material stays in place unlike other brands that I have found that can lump and bunch and have less capacity."

The only issue I would like to see addressed is the fact that frequently the elderly have issues with arthritis, and there is a wrapping around the product that requires a good, strong pull to remove. Obviously, pulling can be painful for arthritics,  so I would recommend  removing the wrapping,  and for all the cost that might include (and to transition that cost to serve those who like the wrapping) you might perhaps include one complimentary, reusable and recyclable plastic privacy pouch for those who need to have a concealed spare in their purses, etc.  
Having the underware ""unfettered"" --as it were--in the original packaging is really ideal for those who need to use it daily and without any extra painful steps in doing so.

This isn't something that any of us like to acknowledge but it happens and if you know you are going to be active, it's better to be safe than sorry.
The Equate Options Incontinence Pads, Moderate Long, 54 count package is a good solution to my problem. When you first open the package you see that the pads are individually wrapped in an easy open cloth-like pouch. Each pad is curved to fit in your under pants with a strong adhesive strip that has a covering that shows the proper (forward) placement of the pad.
A big plus for this pad is the curved shape that fits to the body and the way that it does not show through your clothing: no one can tell you are wearing it. These pads helped me to feel more confident when I was out during my day, not having to worry about having an accident.
I would probably try a lighter protection pad for my personal use in the future because these moderate ones seem to be a bit more protection than I needed but I would purchase this brand of pad. The Equate brand of products have never failed to satisfy mine and my family's needs and I would definitely recommend Equate Options Incontinence Pads to anyone who needs the peace of mind that using a pad gives."

These are comparable to Poise Pads.
I received the 54 count package and the pads are for moderate absorbency and they are the long length. They have premium odor protection and a cotton enhanced Dri-Fit system to protect sensitive skin from irritation.
I tried to keep an open mind, because Poise has so many different pads and some pretty thin ones that absorb a lot of moisture.
Each pad is individually wrapped. The wrapping is large enough to keep for the pad disposal. They have a ""front"" marking on them, which I haven't seen before. They are ""gathered"" along the sides for a better fit. They seemed a little bit thicker than I like, but the absorbency was good for the size. The long length wasn't as long as I'm used to.
I would use these as a night-time pad due to the extra thickness and the shape. They helped me to stay fresh"

I suffered a spinal cord injury causing full bladder Incontinence a few years ago. Recovering, I'm thrilled I only need liners. Before the worst of it for me, I had started with occasional leaks. I've now recovered to having a slow leaking condition. Knowing what I know now, my advice to anyone starting to leak is to stop using period pads, they don't control urinary odor, and the inability to absorp correctly leaves you sitting in bacteria that can lead to the skin breaking down and infections. 

Comfort is high on my list.  Tena is so much better than Poise if you need pad protection and Walmart has the best price. When I saw Always Discreet I had to try them because they were the best comfort when I needed period pads.  These are far more comfortable than tena.  I've seen reviews about the front part of the pad not sticking well. My advice to you, you are not wearing it correctly. When soiled pay attention where you see it. It should be within the centered graphic provided on the pad. Each product is different in this way. Wearing correctly, I couldn't be happier with this product. I like the thoughtfulness of making sure the wrapper helps with disposal. Compared to the other products this pad in regular length is comparable to long. I'm not having any trouble with bunching and sliding.  As for protection, this pad exceeds my expectations. 

I tried to provide all the information I feel has been important to me finding urinary protection. If this review is helpful please check the box."

This caused me to fear that leaks would occur between the lumps, as the filling was not really holding together in a uniform layer. Also, the pad does not lie flat properly when placing it in one's underwear. It tends to ""alligator"" due to the elastic wings. Otherwise, the pad was comfortable, soft, and had excellent odor control. (I also tried the Equate brand Curve max absorbency regular length, and did not encounter this problem at all.

Another unappealing feature of the new version is it has less odour protection.  And the purple/mauve colour is a silly, unattractive marketing gimmick.  I prefer the previous white colour, which suggested cleanliness, and never smelled.  I shared this feedback by email with Poise immediately after trying the ""new improved"" product, and I received an email from a Kimberly-Clark representative extolling all the virtues of the new product, while ignoring the problems.  Trust me, I've tried the product, and the new version has caused me to switch brands, and I won't return to Poise, unless the Poise sees the wisdom of restoring its previous product.

Went with Contour Fit #5. - I read many bad reviews on Contour Fit but found a good price & figured they might work if I order #5. Well, the pads bunch up in the middle and I feel like I'm sitting on a hump and pad is uncomfortable!!! Plus, the new shape makes for material that doesn't go far enough out on sides of pad to protect and what I really don't understand is they are not as absorbent (how does that work?) Honestly, I normally use one (1) original design #4 pad all day but went thru three (3) of these Contour things. Since I ordered thru mail its too much trouble to return at least the unopened pack.

One day to try and save some money, I tried the ""Store Brand"" and to my surprise the Options Brand Light Absorbency, Regular Length Pad was equal to, if not superior to the Name Brands I had been using. They have Premium Odor Protection, meaning there is no embarrassing odor. They have a full adhesive strip on the back, allowing you to be as active as you like without worrying that they will slip around. In addition, the adhesive will not damage panties or clothing. All wetness is instantly absorbed with these pads. If you have sensitive skin like I do, you will be happy to know that these protect against sensitive skin irritation. You do not need to worry about discreetness, wearing this pad is completely undetectable under clothing, even tight jeans or shorts. These pads are individually wrapped, making it convenient to toss in your purse."

Lengthwise they are about the size of two index cards and there is a little bit of really soft cover around the edges as well, kind of a barrier. They are quite thin and light. I took a 1/4 of water and slowly poured it over the entire pad, and no water ran off the side, and the back is like plastic (but not crinkly sounding plastic) so no moisture got through there either, I used the same pad and poured another 1/4 of water on it, and this time some water ran off the side, so these would be great if you are traveling and have to make it to the rest stop, or if you have stress incontinence from laughing or coughing or sneezing. I wouldn't use this level of absorption if you may full out not make it to the bathroom in time. These are great!"

Bulkiness was one of my big concerns when wearing this product to my surprise it had a nice feel. This pad was long enough very good size. The pads are thin and have a great feel, does give you a secure feeling. They are very comfortable to wear no matter what your activities are for the day. While wearing the pad throughout the day I forgot it was on, it was very easy to wear. The pad quickly absorbs fluids when wet , the absorbency of the pad pulls in wetness quickly , so u don't get that ""icky"" feeling. This is number one compared to other pads that make u feel ""blah"" like the wetness didn't go down into the pad but instead seems to sit on top. The size is thin and easily hides in a front or back pocket. Overall I give this product a thumbs up!!! I would gladly recommend this product to anyone wanting discreet security from wetness.

These are my mom's solution to bladder leakage, nothing else fits as well, or holds as much. Sometimes she also has bowel problems (cant control it in time) and these will save the day.
She can still dress herself and bathe (and clean up those unfortuante diarrhea episodes) so for her this style ""pull-up"" is working well. If she ever could not dress herself I anticpate a change to the ones with side tabs. But these stretch well enough for a senior senior to maneuver into, and also snap back into shape.

Colors were fine and I liked the idea that they weren't cut so deep.....You've made a good start but consider the fact that many of the mature group (75 and above) who largely depend on garments like this weigh under 100 pounds and are under 5'2"". The ""yoga""style is pretty good but I could never wear them under exercise pants because there is still too much bulk. The elastic around the legs is too loose. Like I said, you have made a good start but help out us finely aged old ladies and give us to wear that gives us more dignity and less bulk."

The ""quilted"" seam appears to be missing; the pad feels thinner; it moves around and the sides do not stay in place.
