Pros:
It is very well built. It is very easy for her to manurer. It has a nice seat with back support. It sells through Walmart at a very reasonable price. Fast shipping
Cons:
It's a little heavy to lift into and out of the trunk of the car. The basket has tobe removed to fold up the walker. The brakes are very hard to set or work for someone with arthritis. It doesn't fit through some door ways.

This about all I can say."

I carefully did NOT overtighten them upon assembly.  So, I struggled through the trip with one handle that threatened to come off (and did at one point).

Excellent construction and easy to maneuver. The wheels are well made and roll nicely. The steering has stops to prevent turning too far and possibly tipping over - a good safety feature.  

The ""seat"" is split in two which is very nice for accommodating he transition from cast to leg. Even better it rotates so you can park along side a sink or table and rotate 90 degrees to face the surface. The brake includes a parking feature to hold the unit still for working or transitioning.

I had ergonomic crutches, but wanted to use that time to get stuff done around the house, so I wanted something that would give me more ability to move around an multitask (carry things around the apartment, reach for things easily).  This totally does the trick.  I feel so much more confident moving around on this than on the crutches (which I've only used once so far when I went out and stumbled a couple of times).  I don't think I would have bought it had it been full price at the time, since it's only for two weeks, but I would recommend it at any price if you have a longer time that you need to be off one foot. My one complaint is that the pads dig into my shins a bit.  They tout the two-part pad in their marketing materials, but I think it was a mistake to separate into two because it's the internal edges of each pad that really dig in and hurt from frequent us.  I've been using my son's toddler pillow to pad it, but it's not an ideal solution.  Some good firm foam would have been good had I known."

Assembly was fairly easy and no tools were needed to do so. The weight of the walker itself is approximately 19 lbs. Depending of the need to actually lift the walker or load it, 19 lbs. was slightly heavy but manageable to me. The seat on the walker is right at 11 1/2""x 11 1/2"" inches, and the walker itself folds up for easy storage. According to the instruction manual, the maximum weight limit should not exceed 350 lbs. One thing to note is that the Medline Rolling Walker is completely latex free, so those with a latex allergy need not be concerned. The basket under the padded seat also measures at about 11 1/2""x 11 1/2"" inches, but the recommended allowed weight limit for the pouch is 10 lbs. or less. The basket is also removable. The rolling walker should never be used as a wheel chair as injury may occur. The height of the walker is fully adjustable. Always make sure your walker is fully opened before each use. The brakes lock by pulling down on the brake handles and making sure they click into the locked position. Always lock the brakes before attempting to be seated. Never use the walker to pull or lift yourself up as it may roll even when in the locked position. I find that the 6"" inch wheels allow the walker to roll very easily on tile, and concrete. When on carpet or grass I was also able to roll forward and backwards very easily, but I recommend being more cautious on rugs and in the yard. I found the Medline Rolling Walker to be very durable, comfortable, and very easy and helpful to use. Great product, but to avoid injury make sure to fully read ""All"" instructions and cautions provided to you in your manual.

This steel walker is very sturdy. Good for walking on rough terrain and people up to 350 lbs. It might be a little heavy if you need to pick it up for transport.
It was OK to put together once I figured it out. It did take some arm strength. There is an unexplained strap I put to the back because you pull up on it to fold the walker.
The handles are very comfortable and easy to grip. The brakes work well, but I still need to get help on setting the brakes so they lock. It's the same principal as bike brakes. The wheels seem very sturdy, and don't mark the floor, but I wish they weren't so smooth. I would love to see tires with a little 'tread' for use on slippery floors.
The bar that serves as the backrest is easily removable and makes the walker smaller for in-house use. I wish that it was more back friendly, like a chair. It hurts to lean back and I use it as more of a safety bar.
The lift up seat is well made and has good padding. However, it's only 11.5"" wide. Not quite big enough for my bottom, and I weigh 160 lbs. with slim hips.
It's a good, but not great, walker. I wish it had better features. It does not lock shut. There is no place to put oxygen.

Have been trying for months to convince my Significant Other that a wheeled walker would provide her much more stability and safety then using just the walking cane alone. Additionally, the cane frequently adds stress to her wrist, lower arm, elbow, and shoulder, which can expose her to dangerous falls. Important advantages of this Medline wheeled walker is that it allows her to use both hands, which distributes a significant amount of her body weight for greater balance and allows her to walk more smoothly and farther. It even has a padded seat, which enables her to stop and rest, along with a padded backrest. Both hand brakes lock easily in the downward position (they click when locked) for sitting, and, there is a washable, removable bag with Velcro ties for under-seat storage. The handlebars are fully adjustable. The frame is high strength steel, which will support a capacity of three hundred fifty pounds, and carries a lifetime warranty. Most other wheeled walkers are made of aluminum and have far less weight capacity. The Medline Rollator has four, six-inch, non-marking, polyurethane wheels. The walker can be utilized indoors or outdoors. It has a simple strap for folding adjacent to the right of the padded seat. However, it can be moved to the left-hand side, if preferred. Simply pull the strap and the unit folds for convenient storage in your car's back seat or trunk. According to the manufacturer this Medline Rollator only weighs seventeen pounds, making it very easy to fold and transport. To unfold, push down on the handlebars and lock the frame into position when ready for walking. Darlene will actually be using this Medline Rollator to transition from frequent walking cane use to 'as-needed'. Since a wheeled walker cannot be used to go up or down stairs, curbs, unlevel and, or, rough terrain, she will always need to have her cane along too. TIPS: For added safety at night time I added a battery operated, LED bicycle light fastened to the vertical handlebar frame. For added mobility I added self-adhesive, Velcro tie wraps to the other side of the frame for securing a walking cane in place. This unit does not come with a cane holder or light. However, these items are readily available at your local Walmart, where I purchased them.
The Medline Basic Steel Rollator came securely packaged with the parts needed for assembly protected in bubble wrap. It took me ten minutes to thoroughly read the assembly and operating instructions. Then, another fifteen minutes to set up and correctly adjust the height of the handlebars. NO tools are necessary. Medline provides a booklet in the box, which explains the assembly and maintenance in detail along with ample pictures for even more clarity.
I am very pleased with this Medline Basic Steel Rollator, and am confident that this unit in the long run will keep her safer and allow her to more mobile. Highly recommend this unit to anyone now utilizing a walking cane alone or in need of greater mobility."

It arrived at my local Walmart in a few days. Upon assembly the right front tightening knob would not thread properly into the nut, which is welded onto the frame. After repeated tries the tightening knob started into the frame nut cross-threaded.  I reordered another Rollator and returned the initial Rollator to Walmart. The second one assembled easily like  charm in a few minutes. 
The Rollator has given my MIL the confidence to walk outside for exercise again when by herself. It gives reassurance from falling and a place to sit down if necessary.
By design this Rollator is adjustable for seat height via the tightening knobs/ legs at the bottom and the hand grips are adjustable at the top. There are enough positions of adjustment that the Rollator can be easily personalized for comfort for different individuals. It seems to be well built and should last a long time."

The front left wheel was on the left rear and vis a versa.. Now that I can finally use it I may or may not like it.

All adjustments can be done without tools with all adjustment points marked in yellow. My son walks with a wide gait so his right foot would always hit the wheel of his previous walker throwing him off balance. This walker's back wheels are extra wide apart which has allowed him to walk much better. There is a built in cup holder and plenty of storage. Also, it folds up flat, easily fitting is a car trunk. One thing to note is that it is a little heavier than our previous walker and it takes some practice to learn how to fold it up. Also the back wheels are 27 inches apart so some doorways may be a little narrow for it or maneuvering between tables in a restaurant may be more challenging. 
This is a Great, Great walker and I would highly recommend it."

I wasn't sure how comfy the back support would be since most walkers have the roll bar, but it's extremely comfortable to sit on especially with the extra wide memory foam seat.  I also enjoy the ""step in"" feature which most walkers don't have.  My only critique is that it's quite heavy for a woman to be able to hoist into or out of the car, but the ability to fold completely flat helps to compensate for that somewhat.  Overall, it's an extremely good walker for the price."

Even though Mom is slight of weight this can bare up to 350 lbs of weight,  so it's VERY STURDY . Folds ups super easy and is pretty light also . Also has easy push buttons to adjust for height .

It is about 2 pounds heavier than my old rollator and since I drive, I'll have to get used to that bit of extra weight in order to put it into my car behind the driver's seat.

The walker with 4 wheels had hand brakes, which Mom could not work well, due to arthrits in the hands and to turn with a regular walker, you must lift it up a fews times because these wheels do not pivot. It is heavy, which means it is sturdy, and she does not have to lift it at all because she only needs it when she goes out of the house. We store it in the garage and if someone picks her up, she leaves from the garage. It folds up easily to put in trunk. Pivoting front wheels for better turns, comfortable seat, brakes on back legs when applying downward pressure, fraction of the cost at a medical supply store (even with using no insurance, still paid less out of pocket).We had a physical therapist check the height...this is a must!!!

The breaks not only work well, they lock so that you can sit down without worrying about the seat rolling from under you when you go to sit down.

The best part was that when I received that walker the backrest had a tear in it and when I called the company they immediately mailed a new back rest free of charge, no questions asked. Now that's what I call customer service.

Under the seat is not only a large pouch but under the actual seat is a zippered pouch. I love that the pouch is not see through because I don't want people to see what I am carrying if I want to put my purse in there. Great buy."

To my amazement he really loves this rollator and now has his confidence back when walking. We take it with us almost everywhere we go and he loves going to the large indoor mall and spending the afternoon there walking around and resting on the seat when he gets tired of walking. We had gone to a medical supply store and looked at several other rollator models that were much more expensive; priced from $225 to over $300. This carex rollator exceeded the quality and ease of operation of several of the higher priced units. The assembly was easy, took only about 15 minutes and no tools needed. The size is right and we especially liked the fact that it is so lightweight and fully adjustable for handle and seat height.

The Drive Rollator has restored the peace and harmony of our home by allowing my wife to reclaim her mobility and independence.
The rollator was very easy to assemble, no tools required, using the spring loaded pins on the handles and backrest. While it is light weight and easy to fold and load into the car, it is well balanced and provides the stability my wife needs to go where she wants. Happy again !
Pros: Attractive finish, light weight, easy assembly, stable, overall width 23 1/2"", brakes are nice, steers easily with 4wd....just a few dollars more than the walkers with tennis balls instead of wheels. I ordered on a Friday morning, paid $10. for expedited delivery, received on Monday.
Cons: None ...so far...
I am sure my wife would like to go back to conditions ""before the fall"" but at our age this is a great solution to her mobility challenges. Highly recommended"

After four or five years, the plastic seat on my old walker cracked. Since Drive doesn't make replacement seats, I had to order another entire walker. From the photo, I thought I was buying an identical walker, but not so. The seat has been redesigned; the overall width of the walker is about two inches narrower; and the overall height is about an inch taller. The seat, which now has metal supports under it, is about an inch taller and also narrower from front to back and about 2"" from side to side. This may be important if you are shorter than I am (5'4"") or if you are a heavier person who filled the old style seat to capacity. This walker really needs height adjustments for shorter people who are using it as a brace. If you are using it for unsteadiness, the height shouldn't be a problem.
Rather than using the walker because of unsteadiness, I lean heavily on it and sit frequently to relieve pressure on a pinched nerve in my back. I remove the push down brakes (easy to do) and replace them with glides so that the walker moves freely even when I am leaning on it. Although this walker is heavier than those without seats, for me the benefit of the seat offsets the added weight. I'm still able to lift it and put it in the car. The walker folds easiy, fits behind the driver's seat, tucks away when at restaurants, and comes in handy when waiting in lines. The seat can be used as a platform to put packages, books, serving trays, etc. and solves the problem of how to use a walker and still transport items from one place to another.
I recommend it. It makes my life closer to normal and allows me to function independently.
It would be nice if it came in fashion colors but I guess basic black will do."

I should also mention that I do not use a rollator daily. I only need it occasionally when a condition I have makes walking painful.

This rollator had three things important to me:

- Comfortable seat and backrest-soft fabric. Makes eating at the table much more comfortable.
- Easy to fold - folds side-to-side, rather than front to back. Has convenient clip to hold it together when folded. VERY narrow when folded.
- Soft grip rubber tires - needed to grip floor and not slide when sitting or standing. Also very quiet when rolling across hardwood or tile floors. Be wary of harder, black PVC tires.

The large 10"" front tires roll easily over a threshold that stopped 6"" tires on a borrowed rollator cold!

I also like the brake cables running down INSIDE the frame. Loose cables are a pain!

A bonus is the fabric storage pouch folds automatically when you fold it without having to remove it.

Time will tell, but this seems like a top notch rollator."

The walker is also easy to fold up and place in our car when we take her places. Comments we got from other family members: attractive, not too big, and easy to maneuver, plus folks were surprised it didn't cost more for how nice it was."

It is definitely superior to the competitors' options. I purchased this for my mother who has arthritis in her hips and knees and is not able to hold herself up when walking. So she bares a lot of weight on her rolator, or when seated on it. The two (2) cross bars are more than double the thickness of rolators from Lumex or Drive. We replace her walker usually on an annual basis, since it gets a lot of use/wear. I'm hopeful that this model will out-live her former rolators. The last one I purchased was a Lumex model from Amazon.com, and it didn't even hold up for 9 months! So frustrating! Thank you Hugo for building a decent rolator that supports up to 300 lbs. and has 8 inch wheels. It's really getting hard to find rolators with 8 inch wheels that support up to 300 lbs! Thanks again. My mother is very happy! :-)"

This one has larger wheels which allows it to be used on grass and transitions well between paved surfaces and natural walkways much easier . Because of the larger wheels it has a taller profile that allows my wife to sit more comfortably (she is a taller lady).Everything on this Hugo works as we expected after owning the previous one.

They tout the two-part pad in their marketing materials, but I think it was a mistake to separate into two because it's the internal edges of each pad that really dig in and hurt from frequent us.
