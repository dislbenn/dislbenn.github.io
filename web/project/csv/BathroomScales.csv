The Ozeri Touch includes built-in memory for up to 8 user profiles with auto recognition technology for shared use at home, the office or the gym. Each profile stores weight, gender, height, and age data so that your family members can each track their progress. The Ozeri Touch Total Body Scale combines advanced algorithms with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), incorporating a person's age, height, gender and weight, for its accurate measurements. BIA is a well-established and respected method used to estimate body fat and hydration. Muscles, blood vessels and bones are body tissues with a relative high water content which conducts electricity easily. Body fat is tissue that on the other hand displays much less electric conductivity. With BIA, the Ozeri Scale sends a weak and harmless electrical current through your body to determine the amount of fat tissue. This weak electrical current is imperceptible to the user, and returns back data that is used to instantly calculate the advanced measurements. The Ozeri Touch Total Body Scale displays all results on its easy to read high-contrast LCD screen with blue digits. It utilizes 4 latest generation GX sensors to capture weights up to 440 lbs (200 kg) with industry leading accuracy. With its innovative Tare feature, the Ozeri Touch Bath scale also eliminates all the stress with weighing an infant or pet. Simply step on the scale to record your weight, step off and back on again while carrying your infant or pet, and the scale accurately displays both weights on separate sections of its bright LCD.
