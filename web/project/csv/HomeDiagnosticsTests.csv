The intensity of the lines may vary due to a variety of factors: how diluted is the urine, the pH or protein level of the urine, interference from a metabolite in the urine that closely resembles the drug. <br /> <b>How soon after taking a drug can you detect it in the urine with EZ Level At Home Drug Test and how long can a drug be detected in the urine?</b> <br />Most drugs can be detected in the urine within a few hours after taking the drug; however this can vary depending on the type of drug taken, the amount taken, the frequency of use, and the metabolism of the person being tested. Each drug is cleared by the body at different rates. Some drugs, for example marijuana, can stay in the body for up to several weeks after use. <br /> <b>How accurate are EZ Level Marijuana THC At Home Drug Tests?</b> <br />EZ Level drug testing products are more than 99 percent accurate in detecting specific drugs in urine. The accuracy of the test depends on several factors such as how close to the cut-off level the drug is in your urine, how soon the test was administered after ingesting a drug, and how much of the drug was used or ingested."
