I really resisted buying a cane, but my husband kept insisting I buy one, and jokingly said that since red was my favorite color, I should buy a red one. The rest is history. Not only is this red, but it is a nice subdued red and it isn't garish and it doesn't call attention to itself. The cane is adjustable and to me, it seems very sturdy. I have been using it a lot the past two weeks, and I like it. I am fairly tall, and the cane was easily adjusted to my height. I will almost be sorry when I am totally healed and can put the cane away. It is excellent, the price is good, and it shipped almost immediately. I believe I had it within five days of placing the order. My husband was able to pick it up at our local Walmart, with no trouble at all. I love being able to order online. Well done Walmart!"

You don't have to be worrying about where to put your cane when you're not using it for a moment or two. You can just leave it standing until you need it again.

It did get scratched almost right away and the color came off. In looking it over, there are multiple areas where this happened. (I have been using the cane for just over 1 week) The areas are small so it is not a big deal, just be careful with it and it should be fine.
Only other complaint is that they put a sticker right where you hold the cane on the padding, so where you take the sticker off, that part is still sticky where you grab on, so get a napkin or cloth and rub it over the area until the stickiness goes away. They should have put the sticker on the metal part to begin with."

At the time, I weighed about 380 lb. I am in my 60s, and am not as steady on my feet as I used to be. I try to donate blood whenever the bloodmobile comes to our small town, but there were some difficulties. First, the location for the bloodmobile was one block away, which doesn't seem like much, but due to how the streets were laid out I would have to walk almost three blocks to get there. I could cut directly across, but that portion of the block was undeveloped and very uneven, with a lot of small runoff gullies etc. I didn't trust myself to be able to cross that area safely. In addition, the bloodmobile itself is a converted bus, and the step down when exiting is rather high and not very wide. To be safe, I looked around, and selected this cane. I like it a great deal. It is easily adjustable for height, the four feet make it more stable and less likely to slip or slide than a single foot, and the shape of the handle is very comfortable to use. In addition, the apartment I am now living in has a step down platform between the apartment door and the floor of the apartment. I leave my cane there at the edge of that platform, and use it like a railing to help me step down without stumbling.  All in all, a very good product.
The reason I didn't give it five stars is because the rubber caps on the feet keep falling off. So far I have replaced one three times, and am waiting on the delivery of another order of feet to replace the fourth missing one. I plan to use some silicone sealant with this one, so hopefully it won't fall off any more. If you purchase this or any cane, I would recommend purchasing at least one replacement tip to have handy if needed."

I wanted something that was functional on uneven terrain - we live in a mountain resort community with few sidewalks.
I've been using the HurryCane outdoors for a week or so now and find I am able to walk further without tiring so easily. My husband commented that my gait is more steady and I'm not limping like I was before as my knee would quickly weaken when walking. The HurryCane works well on unpaved surfaces for me but I haven't tried it for wilderness hiking, yet. :-)
I was initially embarrassed to be seen using a cane, but my newfound mobility helped me overcome that stigma quickly. The HurryCane is sleek and stylish and fairly unobtrusive to use. I love the fact that I could adjust it to fit my height (I'm 5'8"") and that it folds up in its carrying bag to easily store. I'm happy with my purchase!

Opens and closes with ease, adjustable and very nice color.  Only thing I would have liked to have seen included is a strap.  Have gotten  compliments on style.  Used on last cross country flight and folded beautifully for storage in seat pocket.  Would recommend highly, especially for price.  Excellent value."
