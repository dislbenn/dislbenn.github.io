I began having problems with my knee and bought something that was nothing more than an elastic bandage. It was junk. I then got one (not an Ace) that just wrapped around my leg above and below the knee. It provided support but had some problems. It would tend to slip down my leg. It had an opening between the top and bottom strap, so if I tightened it enough so it wouldn't slip, the flesh of my leg would bulge (swell) out the sides. The most annoying problem was that it would irritate the back of my knee and cause substantial itching, plus it seemed to make my leg sweat in that area. By the way it was made by a different manufacturer that begins with M.
This Ace has been MUCH MUCH better. You have to initially slide it up your leg (slight negative) because it has a smooth cloth that fits behind the knee and has not caused me any irritation there at all. It doesn't slip, I don't seem to sweat with it, and there is no irritation to the back of my knee. It has 3 straps that completely encapsulate the knee so I've had no bulging. It's a good product for me and I would definitely recommend it to others."

(They don't make them like the used to). The brace is not as flexible as the older version of the ACE knee brace. Also, it's a ""one size fits all"", so if you are overweight or your knee is very wide, this style may not work for you. My knee width is a bit chunky; it measures 15"" in diameter, and the brace does fit. The price offered by Walmart is fair.

I use the brace to stabilize my knee when I do physical therapy."

The design has improved over the years and is generally very comfortable. My only complaint is that the sizing was more snug than I expected. Now that they have made the thumb loop a continuous part of the body, rather than a velcro adjustable part, the unit was initially more snug than I prefer. However, I have stretched it slightly by placing it over a jar when I am wearing my other supports, especially at night. It is now even more comfortable and does an excellent job when I am working at my keyboard.
Size info: my palm is 9.5inches at the width and my wrist is 7.75inches around. If your sizing is more than 1/4th inch larger than mine, this is probably not the unit you want."

I couldn't find mine recently and decided to try his instead since my wrist was hurting pretty bad each time I tried to move or bend it. As soon as I put this brace on, I could tell the difference. The lower cut to allow full hand movement helps so much. I work in offices and am constantly typing and filing so to be able to still type on a keyboard as well as do other functions around the office. I'll probably be buying another one of these for myself so that my boyfriend can have his back. No matter what I have tried in the past, nothing has helped to alleviate the pain in my wrist like this brace does. It gives just the right amount of support and is able to be used either wrist depending on which one is giving me trouble.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I would really like to have the adhesive all along the pad or even around the whole outer edge instead of on just the two ends on the neck wraps. I find that when adhering it to myself, I'm stretching and reaching to get the pad where I need it and it feels tight but once in a resting position, it isn't tight at all and the middle, where the heat is, doesn't touch my skin unless I'm lying on it or wearing a tight shirt.

I have no real back problems I'm just out of shape and over working makes my lower back hurt, sometimes for days. These back braces hold you in a good position and make your back work less hard. My husband has had several back surgeries and he still like to wear his brace if he's going to be out walking or picking up things in the yard.

I thought it would take a week or so to get it, but it actually arrived at the local Walmart for pickup within a few hours of the same day I ordered it. That was fast.  I put the Meuller wrap on  and soon realized this was very helpful in relieving any pain or soreness. I felt I also needed to stretch my leg muscles and do some jogging too, and wore the wrap when jogging with encouraging results.  My back and legs are doing much better now. Perhaps it was the natural healing of my body, but wearing the wrap during the sore times to get through this sure helped.

Since I refused to stop exercising or running despite the discomfort, I had to find a bandage that worked.

I finally bought an Ace elastic bandage and found that the purchase was well worth it. The Ace product was exceptionally supportive, alleviating most, if not all, the pain. It kept its elasticity for a considerable amount of time as well.

I will never buy another brand of elastic bandage again--Ace is the brand for me."

After some research on the internet, I realized that icing and rest were the best remedies. I googled wrist supports and luckily ran across this one. I immediately liked that it was sized for women and was a neutral color, as opposed to one of those big, bulky black contraptions. Ladies, believe it or not, the lining inside is pink - a nice feminine touch! Although light, it is well-constructed and the adjustable Velcro straps make it easy to apply as much or as little pressure as you need; I even slept with it on. Best of all, it holds your wrist in a neutral position that allows the tendons to rest and helps avoid re-injury. I have noticeably improved since I began wearing this wrist support."

I now have one of these braces for each hand. I found it when I only needed it for my right hand about ten years ago. I have gone through three of them since then. They wash well, but be sure to put it in a bag before you throw it in the washer. Air dry only. No bouncing around in the dryer, especially with heat.
The second most important aspect of this brace, other than comfort is that it allows me to use my hand and do everything I want to do without restriction OR pain. Rather remarkable for a brace, in my experience. I have recommended them to everyone I know who needs a brace such as this."

It is just the right size for me, not too big not too small. I have a small wrist and this fits perfectly. Not too bulky either, some of the others I tried where too bulky for me.

I need it at night only to sleep, I do not usually wear it during the day. I read some of the reviews about the velcro, so I leave it open when not in use, so I don't over use the velcro. I don't over tighten the straps beacuse I don't want to cut the circulation to my hand.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the wrist support and would recommend. It's better looking than most supports out there as well. If you need to wear it out, the grey and pink should be neutral enough. I advise trying it on at the store for correct fit. So if you need a small support this maybe a good option for you.

I went to the local sports store and picked up the 2XU sleeves. They cost me 50 bucks. I wasn't sure if they were for me so I tried for a couple of days. Decided they were fine and returned them. Found these on Walmart for half the price. The only difference is the material. The 2XU brand uses a spandex like material which wicks away the sweat and leaves a cool feeling on the calves. These do not. The material is thicker so keep that in mind. That is the only difference I found. Works great for me and I would recommend them to anyone who is unsure about compression sleeves and would like to try them (merely due to the price).

He really likes this support, but after wearing it everyday for a week at work, he is a custodian so his on his feet most of the day, the part where the center ring is started to become painful at the top of his knee. In the center of this support there is a open circle at the kneecap. At the top of the circle there is a very thick piece of foam sewn in . He said the foam really stabilized his kneecap but after time it caused some soreness at the top of his knee, it was a little bit to stable for him. ( This may not be the case for everyone).The circle is stitched in two places, I just opened the stiching, pulled out the foam and restiched the circle. No more knee cap pain but it still stabilizes the side of his leg where the knee is and keeps his leg from bowing after eight hours of work where is on his feet all day, custodian, or when doing other things.
