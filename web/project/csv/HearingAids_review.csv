The expense and repairs for the big brand hearing devices have sometimes left me to go without for extended periods of time.  I am glad to have found a much cheaper alternative (thousands cheaper) that exceeds or matches the performance of the expensive brands.  With the smartphone capabilities of this device I could not be any happier.  I would recommend this product over any of the large manufacturers as I have had experience with the majority of them.

Also, they only mariginally aided my hearing problem. They amplified my own conversation, but not so much the conversation of others.

It also took her a few days to get use to adjusting the volume.   After that, they've been working great so far.  She was surprised because her doctor told her she had severe hearing loss and didn't think a product like this would help.  Anyways, it did!  She loves them.  Its only been a couple weeks so we do not yet know how they will hold up, but we did get the 4 year warranty.  The manufacturer's customer service line is also very helpful.

It has worked just ok. I did not like the fact the hearing aids were riding in the same place as my glasses. When the old hearing aids broke, I was determined to get an in-the-ear aid this time. I was very concerned about the price because I had paid 2500.00 for the old ones. When I found the Wal-Mart hearing aids on the internet for less than 600.00, I was skeptical to say the least. But I finally decided that I would rather waste 500+ dollars than waste another 2500.00 (or more). I ordered the hearing aids and they arrived very quickly. They are easy to use, work well and so far have good battery life. I open the aids so the battery isn't activated when in storage as suggested in the product info book and it seems to be working.

In my job I deal primarily with older people and a common complaint among them was the high cost of hearing aids....and many people put off addressing their hearing problem because of this...including myself. I commonly hear numbers in the 5 to 6 thousand dollar range being talked about. I would never pay that much either.

When I received my product I easily installed the batteries that were incluced and placed each hearing aid in the appropriate ear. I was amazed at the immediate improvement in my hearing.

I am impressed with the quality of these hearing aids. They fit comfortably within each ear and are barely visible. They are very easy to use.

I wholeheartedly endorse this product to other's in similar situations."
HearingAids,Walmart #  563273645,Simply Slim Smart Touch Hearing Aid Pair,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simply-Slim-Smart-Touch-Hearing-Aid-Pair/14004237,"Only issue I have is with the initial feedback when inserting the hearing aid into my ear. But otherwise they are comfortable and work very well with my degree of hearing loss. I had hearing aids that cost me 5000, digital ear molded in the canal aids that popped out when someone hugged me and my ear was jostled which ended up with the case being cracked. The simply slims do not dislodge when jostled or need adjustment when eating. I do think I will have issues with using them on the phone because of the feedback from the handset. Hopefully the telephone pads will work. I like the slim size since I have small ear canals and they fit perfectly."

The high pitched beeping of the device can come up anytime, very annoying, people next to me can hear it. I was planning to use them for my work day, but the performance is well below my expectation."

HearingAids,Walmart #  563477386,Simplicity Hi Fi EP Hearing Aid Pair,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simplicity-Hi-Fi-EP-Hearing-Aid-Pair/14004243,"These hearing aids were for my Mom.
She has 50% hearing loss in both ears, and debilitating Tinnitus. She was shocked and overjoyed to find that these eliminated about 75-85%  of the Tinnitus ringing in her ears. The result is she became 10 years younger,  with abundance of energy!

She got use to adjusting the volume (which she was able to learn how to do while wearing), she was able to hear me from another room. She could watch a movie on T.V. without closed captions!

Walking outside was more of a challenge since she was visiting me in NYC. She learned to turn them way down while walking down the street, because of sirens and loud trucks going by. But even still, they provided much relief from the Tinnitus therefore less stress from the street noise!
Although difficult at first, she learned how to open the battery compartment, so that every night she can save on using the battery up. I don't know yet how much this prolongs the life of the battery, but it was suggested in the instructions.

The ear piece was comfortable and she could not even feel the aid resting on her ear, nor the tube/inside ear piece that was in the ear, at all. And it was not even visible, as well! Definitely recommend!"
HearingAids,Walmart #  563477386,Simplicity Hi Fi EP Hearing Aid Pair,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simplicity-Hi-Fi-EP-Hearing-Aid-Pair/14004243,"I bought this pair because it is advertised for musicians. I listen a lot to music, but too soon when I increase the volume on the hearing aids there is the whistling sound of feedback. It's there to early and too often for me. I'm wearing them now for about 10 days. Seems to be the top-of-the-line product and I'm not sure if I will hang on to them."

HearingAids,Walmart #  563477386,Simplicity Hi Fi EP Hearing Aid Pair,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simplicity-Hi-Fi-EP-Hearing-Aid-Pair/14004243,Bought them for my husband.

HearingAids,Walmart #  563477386,Simplicity Hi Fi EP Hearing Aid Pair,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Simplicity-Hi-Fi-EP-Hearing-Aid-Pair/14004243,"The 'made for musicians' claim got my interest. After four conversations with the great tech support I was confident my audiogram was typical so a one-size-fits-all unit would help me. I even got the audio distortion figures. With a 90 day trial what could I lose? I have severe to profound loss, 55 and 45 dB at 2 KHz, 75 and 65 dB at 4 KHz. I turn the volume up almost all the way. It is a tremendous help with voices although with my huge hearing loss I can't expect miracles. Orchestral music sounds as sweet as I remember. The string section sounds clean as can be. I love hearing birds and the click of my mouse button. There is no background noise problem. The devices are small, confortable, and nearly invisible. My hair touches the top of my ear and covers the unit. My only complaint is that if I accidently touch the top of the unit it turns the volume control. I have never tried a custom programmable digital hearing aid so I can't compare."
HearingAids,Walmart #  563477378,General Hearing Instruments Simplicity Hi Fi 270 Hea  ...,https://www.walmart.com/ip/General-Hearing-Instruments-Simplicity-Hi-Fi-270-Hearing-Aid-Pair/11982008,"I think I have tried out almost all of the online purchase, preset hearing devices on the market at this stage of the game, and these Simplicity Hi Fi 270 are the best that I have come across so far. For my ears anyway!
I started out 2 years ago with the $600 a pair, MD hearing aids, and then returned them before the end of their 45 day trial period, as I found the Able Planet company, in ear hearing aids, (shipped to my door for $954) to be better. Even better than the Walmart Simplicity Smart Touch hearing aids, which I also tried and returned to my local Walmart store, for my refund.
I also tried the Wamart in ear ones, Terrible! Don't even bother with those.

I was trucking along with the afore mentioned Able Planet hearing aids for 8 months and impressed with the sound quality. They work by tapping your ears twice to change the settings from 1 thru 4. The problem with this, I found was that when closing my car door from inside the car, or driving with the window open, they would change settings by themselves. Also when in a loud music enviornment like a bar, the base or drums would also change the settings on them.
I got these Hi Fi 270's shipped out to me just 2 weeks ago, and I've been wearing them ever since in place of the Able Planet ones, which now sit in a drawer at home as spares, as it is now too late to get a refund for them.
Just before I ordered these Hi Fi 270's, I went to Costco's and did a free in store trial of their, much more expensive stuff (over $2000 a pair), which they program for you in the store, but found them not even as good as the Able Planet ones which I was then using.

To conclude my review, and I hope it is not getting too confusing, I feel that these Hi Fi 270's for $954, are as good as it's going to get for me, even if I were to go out there and give $6000 or more to an audioligist.
I like the volume controls turning knobs, which allow me to adjust the volumes independantly, and they can be turned up louder than any of my previous sets. The origional size 10 batteries are still going strong, even after 2 weeks!! which makes me feel that I was correct in not going for the bulkyier looking 270 EP's with the bigger size 13 batteries.
As well as appreciating music again with these units, I can still hear people speaking more clearly, than with all the others I have used.
Thank you GHI (General Hearing Instruments) and Walmart respectively, for the best product and a great service."
HearingAids,Walmart #  563477378,General Hearing Instruments Simplicity Hi Fi 270 Hea  ...,https://www.walmart.com/ip/General-Hearing-Instruments-Simplicity-Hi-Fi-270-Hearing-Aid-Pair/11982008,"I procrastinated for years on buying hearing aids due to high prices, and the thought of visiting an ear doctor several times to get them to work correctly. What a thrill it has been to find the Simplicity Hi Fi 270 Hearing Aids. The price was reasonable and they worked perfectly right out of the box. It took me about one minute to put on both the Left and Right, and another minute to adjust the volume level to provide significant amplification without whistling. I immediately heard sounds that I had been missing for years. They greatly improve my high frequency hearing for both music enjoyment and speech recognition. At the same time, they don't over-amplify loud sounds or lower frequencies. I routinely work with a variety of loud power tools and their sounds don't cause any problem with these hearing aids. Batteries last me about 2 weeks, based on wearing them 7 days a week, for 16-18 hours per day.

The only annoyance I found is when I wear my cowboy hat, the brim causes some feedback (whistling sound) due to the Hi Fi device located behind and near the top of my ear. It's a fairly minor issue that forces me to turn down the hearing aid volume a bit to stop the whistling. Interestingly, the lower volume doesn't really reduce my hearing because the hat brim directs sounds down toward my ears anyway.

Simply put, the Hi Fi 270's enable me to hear musical highs, people who speak very softly, and my TV turned down a couple of notches from where it used to be. They accomplish all this without overpowering the sounds that I can already hear well. I commend Walmart for offering these devices at an affordable price."

The sound quality is very good, but the right ear worked fine and the left ear quickly broke, nothing but static. I'm awaiting a replacement from the manufacturer.
Shoppers should be aware that these have only a volume control, no frequency adjustments. Also no on/off switch. I open the battery compartment at night when I take them off in order to extend battery life. I've had the one ear for a couple of weeks and the battery is holding up okay.
Also, while there is some feedback, it is much much softer than what I experienced with my previous pair (the different brand ones). Assuming I get good replacement service, I would recommend these for moderate, high frequency hearing loss."

It has worked just ok. I did not like the fact the hearing aids were riding in the same place as my glasses. When the old hearing aids broke, I was determined to get an in-the-ear aid this time. I was very concerned about the price because I had paid 2500.00 for the old ones. When I found the Wal-Mart hearing aids on the internet for less than 600.00, I was skeptical to say the least. But I finally decided that I would rather waste 500+ dollars than waste another 2500.00 (or more). I ordered the hearing aids and they arrived very quickly. They are easy to use, work well and so far have good battery life. I open the aids so the battery isn't activated when in storage as suggested in the product info book and it seems to be working. I can even hear myself breathe now! I'm glad I took the chance and purchased the Wal-Mart in-the-ear aids."

The first one I used lasted about 20 days. They come with the guarantee that if this is not the case, then you are entitled to ask for your money back.  The packaging allows for easy access, especially important for the elderly who do not want to have to fiddle with ""hard to access"" batteries.  The packaging also fits conveniently into a pocket or a purse.

This is a mercury-free product.  Not only is this a benefit as far as the environment is concerned, it does not detract from the performance as far as the hearing aid itself is concerned.  It can be disposed of with normal household waste safe in the knowledge that no mercury is impacting the environment.

It seems counter-intuitive that many brands of hearing aid batteries have tabs that may prove problematic for the elderly to grasp. The elderly, being the very demographic most likely to use hearing aids, often are the ones who may have the most physical or mental challenges associated with grasping small battery tabs. The Duracell folks have got the pull tab design that is the most convenient. However, I found that they last a full two days shorter than the batteries made by Rayovac.
