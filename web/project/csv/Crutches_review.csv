Crutches,Walmart #  552908514,Roscoe Medical Knee Walker Scooter with Basket and P  ...,https://www.walmart.com/ip/Roscoe-Medical-Knee-Walker-Scooter-with-Basket-and-Padded-Seat-Black/30329307,"I really like this Roscoe Knee walker. It rides very smoothly with the large rubberized wheels. The balance is really good and the ability to adjust the height of the handlebars and the seat is a major plus. The contour of the split seat adds to comfort.  The parking brake is very handy. At first I thought it unnecessary but I quickly learned the importance of it.
I have been using the knee walker for two weeks now and I am overall pleased with it. The turns are wide and sometimes I must lift the front to aim it but that is no big deal. This is needed only for sharp turns. The basket is a big plus. It is amazing how much we rely on little things we 'travel' with.
The big draw back is the wheel alignment to the handlebars. As stated in another review the front wheels are not aligned with the handlebars. They are off by about an inch which can be/is annoying. When aware of it one can compensate but given the purpose of the walker, to transport injured, hurting people I would think that this could have been corrected at the assembly plant since it plays a crucial role in recovery and has been reviewed by others. I tried to make the adjustment myself but the collapse section prevents me from loosening the bolt enough to move the handlebars into alignment. I am 61 years old and I'm going to see if my 82 year old dad will look at it to see if he can help fix it.
This is a nearly perfect knee walker. Roscoe should take action to correct this so that I and others can write that this is the perfect knee walker with a 5 star plus rating. With all of the pluses associated with this walker it shouldn't be too costly to correct it at the source so that Roscoe will be number 1 in my book."

It allows me to have a lot more pain free freedom, both around my house and while going out to doctors appointments and errands. The only problem with this scooter is turning capability as mentioned in other comments. It is very awkward in tight spaces and requires some manipulation of the rear end of the scooter. The basket on the front is a lifesaver for carrying drinks, food, cell phone, etc. The price was very reasonable and less than renting in my case. Overall, I highly recommend this scooter."

I ordered it on a  Monday and it was on my doorstep on Wed.  The instructions are pretty worthless, but it's not complicated.  I recommend installing the turn stop in the front wheel before installing the handlebar, as the handlebar can be put on either way, but the slot for the turn stop is only one way.  That is, if you try to turn limiter knob which is just below the center brace and it won't go far in, turn the wheel around to find the slot.  It is ESSENTIAL to safety to have the turn stop installed properly; otherwise, you will fall at some point.  Additionally, the rubber handles installed on the handlebar on mine smelled so bad, I just cut them off.  Still works fine.  Anyway, if I were to do again, I'd spend a little more and get a better quality.  That said, it's ok for the money."

But be careful with any knee walker. The brake in general and when attempting to put parking brake on, most of the time fails. Also, there is a feature to keep the steering from going completely around...it's supposed to go about just a little to the right and left, but that failed after day 1, which makes it a flip hazzard. So, when making sharp turns, you may have to back up and adjust to make a wider turn because it's not if, but when that it will flip. Lastly, BE CAREFUL BACKING UP....because hitting that injured foot or leg on something behind you, thinking you're in the clear as far as space, can set you back on recovery and obviously...THE PAIN will be intense."
