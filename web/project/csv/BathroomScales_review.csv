This precision scale weighs up to 400 pounds.  Its tempered glass and white in color.  The scale has a wide screen LCD which makes it easy to see and read. It has four high precision GX sensors to weigh in pounds, KG or ST increments.  I like the step on activation which captures the weight measurements upon stepping on the scale.  The auto turn off is a great feature to conserve battery life.  The scale operates on a lithium 2032 battery which is included.  A scale that is chic in style and accurate in readings.  The scale is simple to use.  The quality of Ozeri products never disappoint, only impress me.    It offers a sleek design.  With six people in our house, weight varies, so this is the perfect scale in my house.  I would recommend this scale in a heartbeat.  The scale goes with any décor and looks very classy in the bathroom.  I use the scale on a tile floor and it does not rock or move around.  I weighed myself in the morning and I had a doctors appointment that afternoon and my weight was the same as my weight on the Ozeri scale."

I can just manually enter it if I have to go to the app any way. I only got this because it was suggested directly on the Jawbone website to use with the UP2 band. Well ends up if you want it to share the weight with the Jawbone app, then you have to pay some crazy yearly fee. Stupid. Wish I just saved my money and got something better.

This scale also has a tare function, which I have never seen before, which allows you to easily weigh yourself with your infant, pet, or even luggage to determine their weight.  It has the capability of maintaining 8 profiles in its memory which is very impressive.  This is made of an impact resistant tempered glass which can weigh up to 440 pounds.  I never thought I would say that I love a scale since scales and I are not friends, but I love this scale. This is not your parent's scale, and I highly recommend it.  I received this product at no cost and my opinion expressed is a direct reflection of my experience with this product."

In my opinion, it does require a stable, level, hard surface for consistent readings. Therefore I believe that it would be best used on tile or hardwood flooring and not carpeting, especially thick carpeting. I thought the cost of $32 plus S & H. was very reasonable for the quality of this scale. I ordered this scale through Walmart using store to store pick since it wasn't stocked locally. Arrival of the scale at my store was as promised by Walmart to the day.

In the first category, this scale does really well. It tells you your weight and other interesting statistics such your fat percentage. It can also hold info for up to 8 years. Set up was pretty easy right out of the box, and it can hold a larger amount of weight than other glass scales, which is a plus. According to the box, it can hold almost 400lbs (397 to be exact, but that was a humorously precise measurement). It makes me want to find someone who is 398 to see what happens. 

With that said, the biggest disappointment is that there is no app or website with this. The mindset behind weight loss is the small goals you set for yourself and achieving them. Yes, you could easily write down your information, or enter it into another app, but if this had the ability to log it for you, and maybe send little congrats when you hit a goal, it would have made it a five-star product.

Again, this is a well-made scale, that is easy to use and looks nice. Just wish it automatically tracked all of the stats automatically."

It's also really confortable to stand on. I like that how the designed this scale you easily know where to put your feet. You place your gett on the stainless steel sides. The scale works pretty quick once you step on it and is very accurate. I weight on it and then was weighed the same day at my primary care doctor's office and they both said I weight the exact sane down to the pound. Normally scales at doctors offices are the most accurate and I have never had an at home scale that weighed so accurate, that only has me very impressed! I could not be any happier and recommend to everyone. Great at home scale that won't break the bank."

The trainer at the gym has one and I've wanted one ever since. It's great to be able to watch all the parts that go into your complete weight. I can tell how I am losing weight and that's a wonderful thing to be able to keep up with instead of just pounds. 
It does say in the instructions that people that have say a pacemaker should not use this scale as it sends a small electrical current through your body to be able to read fat %, muscle mass, bones, and water. Of course it does say to see your Dr and I'm sure nothing can be 100% right to the exact amount but if your using the scale regularly on a even surface you can keep up with your progress. 
I highly recommend it for anyone who doesn't have anything like a pacemaker etc that could get messed up with the small electrical current. Honestly you can't feel it. Wishing everyone the best on their own journey to be healthier."

Actually, it is not even correct to call it a scale. It is a body analyzer. First off, it takes 4 AAA batteries to be operational. Thankfully, batteries came with the unit. Next, I recommend using the instruction manual to set up a user for the first time. This can hold up to 8 different users types. You will enter your gender, whether you are athletic or not, your height, and your age. Always use this unit on a hard, flat surface-not carpet. It measures your weight quickly. It takes a few second for it to calculate your body water, muscle mass, bone mass, and body fat. I was unpleasantly surprised by some of my numbers. And, I am sure this will be the case with many others too. Honesty can be cruel. Better to get these numbers yourself than from a doctor. This way, you can be working on those numbers before a doctor has to tell you to. The only negative thing I can think of is, it does not store your prior readings. If you want to keep track of them, you will need to write them down. One more thing I want to mention, the body analyzer is not recommended for people with an internal electronic medical device, such as a pacemaker."

And for some other reviews, the response has been to step on and off the scale five consecutive times to ""exercise it."" The point is, why is the customer having to go through ANY type of ""troubleshooting"" in order to get accurate and reliable readings? By making these so-called ""recommendations,"" Health-O-Meter is actually agreeing to the fact these scales are defective. The proper solution(s) would not be for the customer to need to do anything to the machine. When a new product is purchased, there is generally an implied warranty of merchantability, which means the goods are fit for the purpose intended, and that the product conforms to the buyer's standards and expectations. With most of these customer reviews, it can be clearly concluded that these scales have violated this implied warranty.  It's the company's responsibility to correct the defects, and not to tell the customer they need to do something to get the product to work right. Enough of these ""blame the customer"" excuses. I am also returning my new HDM770 Series Weight Tracking Digital Scale for the same reasons as most of the other aforementioned reviews stated...inaccurate, inconsistent, and unreliable.

It also has a great feature that gives you the average weight if they don't stay still and thats accurate as well.

However, it is shipped with this device for measuring how much fat you have lost on various parts of your body. I preferred a better scale and not this additional item which comes as part of the purchase. My old scale did not always set at 0 ... sometimes a pound or so under, others a pound or two less. I got tired of resetting to 0 every time I weighed myself ... so I purchased what I thought was an excellent scale. This new scale seems to need resetting to 0 everything I weigh myself. So, if you do not mind resetting each time and you can use this measuring device, I guess the $20 is a good price. But for just a decent scale, you can get one for about $7.

That results from the good close fit between the platform and the track it rides in. The variation results from the amount of platform weight that the weight sensing mechanism is indicating, which becomes a non issue when standing on the platform. I suggest you set the zero once and forget it. Maybe reset the zero once after the scale is broken in and it consistently reads above zero when not standing on it."

My big goal was to be able to measure losing the visceral fat. The scale took me to ""just normal"" but 3 months after I bought it, lost its ability to help me go farther.

Days 2-4, I consistently weigh 128.8, regardless of whether I am dressed or undressed, time of day, premeal or post meal.  I may have gotten a bad apple.

It also has bone mass and muscle mass. It also has a blue screen that I really like because it makes it really easy to read. I love my scale and think it is a fair price."

The weight does not vasulate  even when you try to wiggle it to a lower number! It's well constructed  both in strength and tightness. This is a great scale for the money! No need to pay more!

The cons are: To start weighing you must tap the scales to start. Sometimes it's difficult to get the scales to recognize the ""tap"". The scale must set on a hard surface. We first put the scales on a rug. The reading on the scales were ridiculous. We then placed the scales on the tile floor and the readings were accurate."

I can't attest to how long this one will last but so far it reads very true to weight, having tested it with actual weights. The digital display reads very easily and, the chrome and glass look is very stylish for a scale of its price.
My only complaint is that there is no memory of different users and keeping their weight logged in, but that can very easily be over looked if you are keeping a fitness/ health log."

It is tempered glass, comes with 3 AA batteries, can weigh up to 400 lbs, and has a nice bright digital display as well as the mechanical dial. So sleek and stylish, I'd almost put it in my den for everyone to see and try.  It can be set to lbs or kgs, and has a reminder alarm to remind you to weight yourself at the same time every 24 hours, and a low battery light."

The strange thing is that when I first step on it in the morning, it reads 114.2 every time. I then get off, and get on again, and it reads 120.6..  I  am  confused as to why I have to  get on twice each time to get the correct reading.
I do think that my correct weight is 120.6, so I just  deal with the quirk,"

But, Im disappointed. My biggest problem is that I think the platform is too big so the readings aren't consistent. I even tried to put small pieces of t ape so I can try and be in the same spot all the time. I can weigh myself and a minute later do it again and be a tad off from the first spot and there's a 3lb difference. So which spot is correct? I find myself using my old scale and this one is in the closet.  Id return it but I had such high hopes that I got rid of the box and shipping papers."
